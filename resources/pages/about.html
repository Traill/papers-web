			<p> Trailhead is your own personal conference scheduler. To make it
			easier for you to find presentations that you care about you can
			search for people or topics and browse connections between
			articles. Whatever you find interesting you can add to your own
			schedule and download it as a pdf or add it to your calendar.</p>
			
			<p> So dive in and click away! Search for a topic you like and use
			the graph to browse between related talks. Any time you find
			something that interest you, go ahead and add it to your schedule to
			get your own personal exquisite conference program.</p>
			
			<p> Should you later decide to add or drop a few talks, despair
			not. Trailhead lets you save your schedule to come back later. If
			you are using the same computer it's as simple as reopening the
			page later, and the schedule will be restored. In case you want to
			transfer the information to another computer, click on 'Save Graph'
			in the top right corner to create your own personal graph.

			<h1 class="orange"> Other use</h1>

			<p><b>Search: </b> Trailhead lets you work with advanced search
			features. You can select different criterions to search nodes in
			the graph like time or location of presentation. The filters are
			saved in the panel and you can toggle and untoggle them.  </p>

			<p><b>Schedule: </b> When you're happy with the schedule you have
			built in the panel, you can either download a pdf with all the
			information about the talks you selected or an ical file. An ical
			file lets you add events in most calendar applications. If you want
			to sync it with your smartphone you should follow these steps: </p> <p>

			<ol class="listContent">

				<li>Create a new calendar on your computer that syncs with your smartphone.</li>
				<li>Add the ical events on this calendar.</li>
				<li>Connect your smartphone and sync. </li>
			<ol>
			</p>

			<p>Alternatively, you can send the ical file by mail and open the
			file on your iphone mail app. If you make some changes later, you
			can easily remove the old schedule in your calendar and add the new
			dates and times to your calendar</p>

			<h1 class="orange"> How does it work?</h1>


			<p>The graph you are looking at is generated by comparing the
			closeness of a bit more than 400 papers submitted to the 2013 ITA.
			They are currently rated based on a naive bayesian textual
			comparison of the similarity of the word frequencies of the
			submittet research.</p>

			<p>This project is developed with the help of a series of great
			tools. The graph is based on <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a>, a
			javascript library for creating SVG graphics. The javascript
			interface is based on <a
				href="https://github.com/unscriptable/curl">Curl</a>, <a
				href="http://radio.uxder.com">Radio</a> and many more. Check
			the code out on <a href="http://github.com/traill">Github</a> for a
			full overview. </p>
