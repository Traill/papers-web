However, as the constellation size increases, a match- ing interleaver can be employed to compensate performance losses, especially in case of structured codes. This interleaver can be generally described by mapping distributions. In this paper, we discuss optimized mapping distributions for short LDPC codes, i.e. in the order of 10 2 - 10 3 bits. We point out that mapping distributions optimized by means of density evolution may not be suited for short codes. An alternative framework is introduced that utilizes an extended version of extrinsic information transfer functions. Their visualization feature helps to identify good mapping distributions for short codes."},"body":{"text":"The combination of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes [1] and bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) [2] is among the most common capacity-approaching coding schemes for bandwidth-limited channels [3]. Many wired and wireless communication systems implement such a combina- tion together with higher-order signal constellations to achieve high spectral efﬁciency, e.g. using M -ary quadrature ampli- tude modulation ( M -QAM). LDPC codes can approach the capacity of single link channels if and only if the block length tends to inﬁnity. However, many packet based communication systems require rather short block lengths.\nWhen combining LDPC codes with higher-order constel- lations, efﬁcient signal mapping design rules are usually ne- glected. So is the interleaver in the transmission chain, because LDPC codes inherently feature a random-like interleaver due to the code structure. The losses are in the range of a fraction of a decibel for practical constellation sizes [3]. But there is an inherent unequal error protection feature, when using irregular (binary) LDPC codes. The reliability of a coded bit is roughly proportional to the number of parity-checks it participates in. At the same time, bits representing a higher-order modulation symbol also exhibit different reliabilities due to their position in the constellation labeling. This mismatch can be exploited to improve the overall system performance.\nFor example, in [4][5] dedicated LDPC codes have been designed for given signal constellations. The joint design of coding and modulation may lead to the best results, however, it is inﬂexible and does not correspond to the BICM principle of choosing coding and modulation independently. For this, an interleaver is of high practical relevance, as all LDPC codes deployed in current communication systems are designed as structured codes to facilitate hardware implementation with lower complexity, e.g. quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes [6]. The\ninterleaver allows for both breaking up structural dependencies in the code and matching it with an arbitrary higher-order signal constellation.\nIn [7][8][9], such a permutation device has been installed between coding and modulation. Based on an optimized mapping distribution, a performance improvement has been reported for constellation sizes up to 64-QAM in [8]. In DVB-T2, an interleaver has been included which is basi- cally found by heuristics [10]. Furthermore, the employed demultiplexer has been improved in [11] by applying the theoretical concept of multi-edge type LDPC codes [12]. Structural properties have been reported in [13][14][15][16], which can also be exploited to optimize the performance, e.g. in the error ﬂoor region.\nIn many related publications, decoding thresholds are an- alyzed by a sort of density evolution (DE) [17]. Optimized degree distribution pairs or mapping distributions can be found in this way. However, these results always relate to very large block lengths and large numbers of decoding iterations. For example, in [8] a block length of 10 6 bits has been used together with 1000 decoding iterations. Furthermore, although efﬁcient approximations to DE exist, optimization may become complex for large signal constellations. Above that, when it comes to the use of short codes, the assumptions made during optimization are not further valid.\nAlthough extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) func- tions [18] also rely on ideal assumptions and are slightly less accurate than DE, they offer some advantages. They allow for evaluating mapping distributions very fast without performing complex DE. Thus, even a large search space can be explored very efﬁciently. Based on this, we propose an alternative optimization method for ﬁnding good mapping distributions in case of short LDPC codes.\nWe consider a common BICM block-by-block transmission over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with noise variance σ 2 n = N 0 as depicted in Fig. 1. N 0 denotes the one-sided noise power spectral density. At the transmitter side a systematic binary (irregular) LDPC code with block length N and code rate R is deployed, which is deﬁned by its parity-check matrix H. To achieve the desired spec- tral efﬁciency M -QAM is used. The signal constellation X holds |X |=M=2 2e complex-valued constellation points. We focus on square QAM constellations with separable mappings, i.e. both in-phase and quadrature components are formed\nindependently. Each constellation point x ∈ X is uniquely identiﬁed by a binary label (x)=[b 1 . . . b 2e ] with b ∈ {0, 1}. The constellation subset X k b ⊂ X denotes those constellation points x which have b at position k in its label (x). We use Gray mapping, which is well combined with LDPC codes and known to maximize the BICM capacity for moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) [19]. In each signal dimension, e bits are conveyed which in turn are characterized by e different bit reliabilities due to the mapping. A bit b k , k ∈ {1, . . . , 2e} corresponds to reliability level j=[(k − 1) mod e] + 1 using the modulo operation. We denote bits at j=1 as most reliable bits (MRBs) and bits at j=e as least reliable bits (LRBs). The channel is deﬁned by its transition probability density function p(y|x)=exp(− ||y − x|| 2 /N 0 )/(πN 0 ).\nAt the receiver side, an ideal sum-product decoder is used. Optionally, outer iterations between soft-demapper and sum- product decoder can be performed, i.e. iterative demapping (ID). However, due to Gray mapping, only small gains are achieved originating from losses induced by independent bit demapping. As the interleavers designed in this paper retain their effect in both BICM systems, i.e. with and without ID, we do not further consider ID. Anyway, interleaver design should avoid four-cycles among modulation symbols [15] for ID.\nAs indicated in Fig. 1, an interleaver can be introduced between coding and modulation. For the general description of the interleaver we use mapping distributions m(x) [8]. Let d v,min and d v,max be the minimum and maximum variable node degrees in the Tanner graph of H. Further, let Λ i denote the fraction of variable nodes in the graph with degree i. The mapping distribution is then deﬁned as\nThe coefﬁcients m j,i represent the fraction of bits residing at variable nodes with degree i that are mapped to reliability level j in the labeling. A valid mapping distribution has to fulﬁll the constraints\nNote that a mapping distribution only describes the proportions in the interleaving process and not the speciﬁc interleaving itself, i.e. which code bit is assigned to which modulation bit. For short codes this procedure plays an important role.\nThe ideal assumptions, which are generally made during analysis and optimization with DE or EXIT chart techniques, lead to mapping distributions which are optimum as long as the\nblock length of the code is large and the number of decoding iterations is large, too. To elucidate this effect, we consider the LDPC code used in [8] with R=1/2, N =99996, and degree distribution pair λ(x)=0.2510x + 0.30938x 2 + 0.00104x 3 + 0.43853x 9 and ρ(x)=0.63676x 6 + 0.36324x 7 . As in [8], the code is constructed by means of the progressive edge growth (PEG) algorithm [20]. For transmission with Gray-labeled 64-QAM, the optimization technique based on DE proposed in [8] yields a mapping distribution m(x) as listed in Table I. To evaluate the performance degradation when deviating from almost ideal conditions, we constructed two further codes with shorter block lengths, i.e. N =9996 and N =996, based on the same degree distribution pair, while avoiding any cycles of length four. The simulated codeword error rates (CWERs) for optimized interleaving based on the mapping distribution given in Table I and (continuously) random interleaving on a per- block-basis as benchmark are depicted in Fig. 2. The best performance is naturally achieved for N =99996 and I=1000. With the optimized mapping distribution a gain of 0.3 dB is achieved compared to random mapping which is in good agreement with the results provided in [8]. When reducing the maximum number of decoding iterations to I=100, we already observe a larger loss for the optimized mapping distribution than observed for random mapping. The performance degrades as the block length is further reduced. The sub-optimality is most apparent for the shortest code. The CWER ﬂattens and shows an obvious error ﬂoor behavior. For CWER< 2 · 10 −2 it already performs worse than without any interleaving.\nThe explanation is basically hidden in the mapping distri- bution. When reducing the block length, the amount of short cycles in the Tanner graph of the code increases signiﬁcantly. In case these cycles have low extrinsic message degrees (EMDs) [21], they lead to an overall performance loss of the code. Trapping sets [22] existing in the code usually comprise these cycles at low-degree variable nodes. Additionally, the minimum distance scales with the block length of an LDPC code. Due to this, we can observe a high number of codeword errors which cannot be detected during decoding, because the decoder has converged to another valid but wrong codeword. As a consequence, we have to account for these ﬁnite-length properties when dealing with short codes and also have to look at the speciﬁc assignment of bits. To identify the overall per- formance range, we additionally investigate the two extreme\ncases: ﬁrst, the modulation bits for one codeword are sorted according to their bit positions in the labeling starting with MRBs and ending with LRBs. Now, (a) the coded bits are sorted according to their variable node degrees starting with the highest degree and mapped one-to-one to the modulation bits (MRB →high degree) and (b) vice versa (MRB→low degree). In Fig. 3, the CWERs for all interleaving options are shown together with their respective rate of undetected errors. We clearly see that for MRB →high degree and the optimized mapping distribution the rate of undetected errors determines the overall performance in the error ﬂoor region. In contrast to this, MRB →low degree offers a very low rate of undetected errors but a very bad waterfall performance. This fact already indicates a fundamental performance tradeoff. When assigning MRBs to low-degree variable nodes, we especially strengthen these low-degree bits and it is these bits which are most harmful when residing on short cycles [23]. When looking carefully at the mapping distribution in Table I, we ﬁnd that a large fraction of LRBs is assigned to low-degree variable nodes and a large fraction of MRBs is assigned to high-degree variable nodes, which explains the observed behavior.\nWithin the information-theoretic framework of BICM, a parallel channel model has been used to describe interleaving and different levels in the bit labeling. The AWGN channel is thus decomposed into a set of 2e parallel binary symmetric memoryless component channels representing the individual bit levels. Each of these component channels can be assigned a dedicated bit-level capacity characterizing the conditional mutual information of the input bit b and the continuous channel output y given the reliability level j according to\nC BICM (j, E s /N 0 ) = 1 − E b,y log 2 x∈X p(y|x) x∈X j b p(y|x)\nwith E s /N 0 = E b /N 0 ·R·log 2 (M). As the conditions in both signal dimensions are equivalent, in (3) only one dimension is considered. The higher the capacity of a component channel is, the more reliable is a bit when using this channel.\nIn [18], it has been shown that the decoder of an LDPC code can be thought of as that of a serially concatenated code. The component codes correspond to mixtures of repetition codes represented by the variable nodes and single parity- check codes represented by the check nodes. During iterative decoding, the output of the variable node decoder (VND) serves as input for the check node decoder (CND) and vice versa. For each of these decoders, overall EXIT functions can be calculated as weighted mixtures of the component EXIT functions according to\nThe weights are given by the degree distribution pair λ i and ρ of the considered LDPC code. The quantity σ 2 ch = 8 · R · E b /N 0 denotes the variance of the channel log- likelihood ratios (assuming BPSK). It is evident that we cannot change the behavior of the CND as it is determined by the code structure, i.e. (5) remains constant for a given code. However, by different mappings we can obviously modify the behavior of the VND by assigning different proportions of variable nodes to different bit positions in the constellation labeling. Note that this is exactly the meaning of the coefﬁcients m j,i in the mapping distribution. The starting point of each elementary VND EXIT function is given by the capacity of the respective bit-level j according to (3). The equivalent noise variance for use in (4) can be calculated by σ 2 ch ,j = J −1 (C BICM (j, E s /N 0 )) with J −1 (·) being the inverse J-function deﬁned in [18]. The overall VND EXIT function is then given by the weighted mixture of all elementary VND EXIT functions:\n(6) C. Example\nAn example for 16-QAM with Gray mapping and the degree distribution pair speciﬁed in Section III is depicted in Fig. 4.\nOn the right hand side, the capacity of both bit levels over E s /N 0 is shown. On the left hand side, the elementary VND EXIT functions for the PEG-LDPC code deﬁned in Section III are drawn including the resultant for no interleaving. The starting point for each bunch of elementary EXIT functions is implicitly given by C BICM (j, E s /N 0 ). The weighted mixture of these curves results in (6), which is obviously characteristic for the chosen mapping distribution.\nLet us now reconsider the different interleaving approaches shown in Fig. 3 by drawing the EXIT chart for each approach in Fig. 5. A mapping distribution which shows good ﬁnite- length properties, i.e. a low rate of undetected errors, has to resemble MRB →low degree. However, this does not lead to a better error rate performance due to a worse overall decoding threshold. Therefore, an appropriate tradeoff has to be found.\nThe optimization of mapping distributions for short LDPC codes needs to be split up into two steps. First, the decoding threshold of the overall system can be maximized by means of DE or EXIT chart techniques, i.e. the required SNR for successful decoding is minimized. Second, if a valid mapping distribution is identiﬁed, ﬁnite-length issues need to be con- sidered when assigning the speciﬁc code bits. However, both steps depend on each other as already highlighted.\nTo tackle the ﬁnite-length issues highlighted in Section III, we have to analyze the given code according to short harmful cycles residing at low-degree variable nodes. As a short cycle is not necessarily bad, we make use of a well-established metric, i.e. the approximate cycle EMD (ACE) [21]. As there are usually no cycles of length four in properly designed LDPC codes, we count the number of cycles of length six (and eight)\nand determine their smallest ACE value. The smaller the ACE value of a cycle, the less it gains extrinsic information that does not originate from the cycle itself. Those short cycles with low ACE values residing on bit nodes of degree two have to be specially treated when generating the mapping distribution. We have to ensure that the proportion of bits from the set of MRBs is large enough that a sufﬁcient number of reliable bits can be assigned to the error-prone bits in the code. This can either be done by appropriately constraining the optimization of mapping distributions or by using the characteristics of the VND EXIT function as identiﬁed in Section IV-C.\nConcluding from our ﬁndings obtained in Section IV, the VND EXIT function for a good mapping distribution when applied to short LDPC codes needs to be steep in the be- ginning. Certainly, the tunnel between VND and CND EXIT functions may not be too small as this lowers the overall decoding threshold. As a result, a higher relative increase of VND extrinsic information is achieved. This effect appears to be especially important for short codes, as after a small number of iterations (3-4) the inherent ideal assumptions in the sum- product algorithm are no longer valid. By this, an erroneous bias in error-prone variable nodes can be avoided, and the number of undetected codeword errors can signiﬁcantly be re- duced. For a similar reason, the VND EXIT function should lie below the VND EXIT curve for no interleaving ( I E,VND, noint ). A certain degree of freedom in shaping the VND EXIT curve is obtained by performing the optimization for some E b /N ∗ 0 which is off the capacity bound, i.e. the VND EXIT function lies noticeably above the CND EXIT function. With this in mind, we can formulate an optimization problem as follows:\nBy solving (7) for small ranges of E b /N ∗ 0 and γ l ∈ R, we ﬁnd valid candidates for good mapping distributions. These candidates can then be further evaluated by simulations to identify the one with the desired properties, e.g. a target CWER. In Fig. 6, two exemplary results are shown. We simulated the CWERs for the short PEG-LDPC code speciﬁed in Section III and for a QC LDPC code with R=1/2 and N =648 as speciﬁed in IEEE 802.11n [6]. In the ﬁrst case, we continue to consider 64-QAM and in the latter case 256-QAM has been applied. We ﬁnd good mapping distributions for both conﬁgurations which are listed in Tables II and III. The corresponding EXIT charts are shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen, in both cases small gains of about 0.3 dB are achieved. However, more important is the performance without showing the onset of an error ﬂoor. When accounting for ﬁnite-length issues as described in Section V-A, the mapping\ndistribution tends to contain more reliable bits at low-degree variable nodes, e.g. compare Tables I and II. This is due to the fact that these bits are needed for being assigned to the error-prone bits in the code. As a result, the number of undetected codeword errors can be reduced and approaches the corresponding performance of no interleaving in Fig. 3.\nWhen applying an interleaver to LDPC-coded BICM trans- mission, one has to put great attention on its mapping distribu- tion. Threshold optimization with DE can only be considered optimal as long as the inherent ideal assumptions are valid. When using short LDPC codes, ﬁnite-length issues need to be considered. We have characterized appropriate mapping distributions by means of extended EXIT functions for the VND. By their shape, we can identify good candidates for mapping distributions for short LDPC codes. Special treatment of the error-prone bits in the code helps reducing undetected codeword errors. Although the achieved gain is not very large, a wrongly-designed interleaver can signiﬁcantly degrade the overall performance, especially in case of short LDPC codes. Higher performance gains for short codes and higher-order modulation are achieved when using non-binary LDPC codes combined with a pure symbol-based mapping [24], i.e. taking care for good bit mappings becomes irrelevant."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"G.
