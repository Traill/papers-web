The key tool in our proof is an L 1 convergence result for the conditional output distributions corresponding to different messages, which follows from the properties of the lattice Gaussian measure.

Perfect security can be achieved by encoding an information message M into a code- word Z in such a way that the mutual information I(M; Z) = 0. However, perfect security is impractical because it requires a one-time pad.\nIn the context of noisy channels, Wyner [1] proved that both robustness to transmission errors and a prescribed de- gree of data conﬁdentiality could simultaneously be attained by channel coding without any secret key. Wyner replaced Shannon\u2019s perfect secrecy with the weak secrecy condition lim n →∞ 1 n I(M; Z n ) = 0, namely the asymptotic rate of leaked information between the message M and the channel output Z n should vanish as the block length n tends to inﬁnity.\nUnfortunately, it is still possible for a scheme satisfying weak secrecy to exhibit some security ﬂaws, e.g., the total amount of leaked information may go to inﬁnity, and now it is widely accepted that a physical-layer security scheme should be secure in the sense of Csisz´ar\u2019s strong secrecy lim n →∞ I(M; Z) = 0 [2].\nExplicit wiretap codes achieving strong secrecy over dis- crete memoryless channels have been proposed in [3, 4]. For continuous channels such as the Gaussian channel, the problem of achieving strong secrecy is still open. Recently, some progress has been made in using nested lattice codes over Gaussian wiretap channels. It is quite natural to replace Wyner\u2019s random binning with coset coding induced by a lattice partition Λ e ⊂ Λ b . The secret bits are used to select one coset\nof the coarse lattice Λ e and a random point inside this coset is transmitted.\nIn [5] the existence of lattice codes (based on the ensemble of random lattice codes) achieving the secrecy capacity under the weak secrecy criterion was demonstrated. Explicit wiretap lattice codes from an error probability point of view were proposed in [6], which also introduced the notion of secrecy gain and showed that Eve\u2019s correct decoding probability lim n →∞ P c = 0 for even unimodular lattices.\nIn this paper we prove that lattice codes can achieve strong secrecy if both Bob and Eve\u2019s channels are mod-Λ Gaussian channels. We follow Csisz´ar\u2019s idea [2] to show that the conditional output distributions corresponding to different messages converge to the same distribution in the sense of L 1 distance or variational distance. As shown in [7], this can be done by choosing a binning scheme such that the bin rate is above the capacity of the eavesdropper\u2019s channel. We propose the ﬂatness factor as a fundamental new parameter to prove L 1 convergence of conditional outputs and to assess the goodness of lattice codes for secrecy. We note that we do not require the message M to be uniformly distributed, which implies that the proposed code features semantic security.\nThe analysis of the mod-Λ channel was a key element in the proof that lattice coding and decoding achieve the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel in [8, 9]. The mod-Λ wiretap channel was already considered in [10] in the context of secrecy with noisy feedback, where it was suggested that ﬁnding good wiretap codes for this model can give signiﬁcant insight to solve the AWGN case. However, as observed in [10], transferring these techniques from the modulo-Λ case to the AWGN case is not trivial since the modulo structure helps to conceal information from the eavesdropper.\nThe lattice Gaussian measure arises in a number of problems in coding [8] and cryptography [11]. Let σ > 0, λ and x be any vectors in R n and Λ an n-dimensional lattice in R n . We deﬁne the Gaussian distribution of variance σ centered at λ as\nf σ,λ (x) = \t 1 (\n1 (\nDeﬁnition 1 (Flatness factor). The ﬂatness factor of the Gaussian measure is deﬁned as the maximum ratio f σ,Λ (x) can deviate from the uniform distribution on the fundamental region R(Λ) of Λ:\nIn other words, f σ,Λ (x) is within 1 ±ϵ Λ (σ) from the uniform distribution. Note that this deﬁnition is slightly different from that in [12]. The difference is that this deﬁnition also accounts for the minimum of f σ,Λ (x).\nis the generalized signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), V (Λ) is the fundamental volume of Λ, and Θ Λ (y) = ∑\nProof: Obviously, E x [f σ,Λ (x)] = 1/V (Λ). Using the Fourier expansion of f σ,Λ (x) [8, 11], we have\nwhere the equality in (a) holds if x ∈ Λ so that ⟨λ ∗ , x ⟩ is an integer, (b) is due to the Poisson sum formula, and (c) follows from the deﬁnition of the theta series.\nRemark 1. The equality in (a) implies that the maxima of both f σ,Λ (x) and |f σ,Λ (x) − E x [f σ,Λ (x)] | are reached if x ∈ Λ.\nDeﬁnition 2 (Smoothing parameter [11]). For a lattice Λ and ϵ > 0, the smoothing parameter η ϵ (Λ) is the smallest s > 0 such that\nThe next proposition shows that the ﬂatness factor and smoothing parameter are in fact equivalent.\nProof: From the proof of Proposition 1, we can see that max x ∈R(Λ) |f σ,Λ (x) − E x [f σ,Λ (x)] |\nIn spite of the equivalence, the advantage of the ﬂatness factor is two-fold:\n\u2022 It gives a precise characterization ϵ by the theta series. Note that it is ϵ, not the smoothing parameter, that is of interest to communications.\n\u2022 The smoothing parameter is mostly concerned with small values of ϵ, while the ﬂatness factor can handle both large and small values of ϵ. The latter is of interest in communication applications [12].\nWe introduce the notion of variational distance or statistical distance between two distributions:\nDeﬁnition 3 (Variational distance). Let p and q be two discrete distributions on a ﬁnite set X . Then the variational distance between p and q is\nSimilarly, for continuous distributions with densities p and q, the variational distance is deﬁned by\nThe ﬂatness factor also gives a bound on the variational distance between the Gaussian distribution reduced mod R(Λ) and the uniform distribution U R(Λ) on R(Λ). This result was already proven in [11] using the smoothing parameter when R(Λ) is the fundamental parallelotope.\nProposition 3. For c ∈ R n let Y (x) = [f σ,c (x)] mod R(Λ). Then\nProof: Observe that restricting the Gaussian measure to any fundamental region of Λ is equivalent to considering the Gaussian distribution mod R(Λ):\nIn what follows we will consider both continuous and discrete random variables as well as mixed pairs of discrete and continuous random variables. Let X, Y be continuous random variables taking values in R n with densities p X and p Y respectively, and M, M \u2032 discrete random variables taking values in a ﬁnite set M n with probability mass functions p M , p M \u2032 . Let p XM (x, m) be the joint hybrid density of the mixed pair (X, M): that is, ∀m ∈ M n , p XM ( ·, m) is the density corresponding to the probability measure µ m (A) = P{M = m, X ∈ A} for all measurable sets A ⊆ R n .\nThe Kullback-Leibler divergence of the distributions p X , p Y is D(p X ∥p Y ) =\nR n p X (x) log p X (x) p Y (x) dx. Similarly, D(p M ∥p M \u2032 ) = ∑ m ∈M p M (m) log p M (m) p\n. It is well known that the mutual information I(X; Y) = D(p XY ∥p X p Y ).\nThe following Lemma is a continuous version of Lemma 1 in [2]. The proof is similar to the discrete case and will be given in the full version of this paper.\nLemma 1. Let X and Z be continuous random variables deﬁned on R n with distributions p X and p Z . Let f : R n → {1, 2, . . . , k} be any mapping, and let M = f(X). If k ≥ 4, then\nNote that Lemma 2 in [2] also holds: for any distribution q Z on R n ,\nLemma 2. Suppose that the number of bins is |M n | = k = 2 nR and that ∀n there exists some density u n over R n such that V(p Z n |M=m , u n ) ≤ ε n , ∀m ∈ {1, . . . , 2 nR }. Then d av ≤ 2ε n and so\nLet Λ s ⊂ Λ e ⊂ Λ b be a nested chain of n-dimensional lattices in R n such that\nWe consider a wiretap channel whose input X n belongs to the Voronoi region V(Λ s ) (i.e., Λ s is the shaping lattice), while the outputs Y n and Z n at Bob and Eve\u2019s end respectively are given by \t {\nY n = [X n + N n b ] mod Λ s , Z n = [X n + N n e ] mod Λ s ,\nwhere N n b , N n e are n-dimensional Gaussian vectors with zero mean and variance σ 2 b , σ 2 e respectively. As in the classical\nGaussian channel, the transmitted codebook C must satisfy an average power constraint\nConsider a message set M n = {1, . . . , 2 nR }, and a one- to-one function f : M n → [Λ b /Λ e ] which associates each message m ∈ M n to a coset leader λ m ∈ Λ b ∩ V(Λ e ). Note that we make no a priori assumption on the distribution of M. In order to encode the message m, Alice selects a random lattice point λ ∈ Λ e ∩V(Λ s ) according to the discrete uniform distribution p L (λ) = 1 2 nR\u2032 and transmits X n = λ + λ m . For λ i ∈ [Λ s /Λ e ], deﬁne\nR i (Λ e ) = ( V(Λ e ) + λ i ) mod Λ s = =\nThe R i (Λ e ) are fundamental regions of Λ e and ∪\nWe now apply the continuous version of Csisz`ar\u2019s Lemma to derive an upper bound on the amount of leaked information on the mod-Λ s wiretap channel (4). Note that even though we consider a mod-Λ s channel, the secrecy condition is given in terms of the ﬂatness factor of the lattice Λ e .\nTheorem 1. Suppose that the ﬂatness factor of Λ e is ϵ Λ e (σ e ) on the eavesdropper\u2019s channel. Then\nProof: Let ¯ Z n = X n + N n e . The distribution of ¯ Z n supposing that the message m was sent is\n1 (\nThe output distribution of Eve\u2019s channel supposing that the message m was sent is then given by\nwhere Y i (z) = [f σ,λ m (z)] mod(R i (Λ e ) + λ i ) has sup- port in R i (Λ e ). From Proposition 3, we have that ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , 2 nR \u2032 }, V(Y i , U R i (Λ e ) ) ≤ ϵ Λ e (σ e ). From the decom-\nRecalling the deﬁnition of d av in Lemma 1, and deﬁning q Z (z) = U V(Λ e ) (z), from the inequality (2) we ﬁnd that d av ≤ 2ϵ Λ (n)\n(σ e ). Then the mutual information can be estimated using Lemma 2.\nFrom Theorem 1, we obtain a sufﬁcient condition for a sequence of nested lattice wiretap codes to achieve strong secrecy:\nCorollary 1. I(M, Z n ) → 0 as n → ∞ for a sequence of lattices Λ (n) e such that ϵ Λ (n)\nWe now consider the problem of ﬁnding a sequence of lattices Λ (n) such that ϵ Λ (n) (σ e ) = o\nTheorem 2. There exists a sequence of lattices Λ (n) such that the ﬂatness factor goes to zero exponentially:\nϵ Λ (n) (σ) ≤ γ n 2 \t (8) as long as the generalized SNR γ < 1.\nProof: Our new averaging bound for the theta series (see the Appendix) guarantees the existence of a sequence of lattices Λ (n) such that Θ Λ (y) ≤ 1+ 1\n. For this sequence, Proposition 1 gives\nTherefore, if Eve\u2019s generalized SNR γ e is smaller than 1, then strong secrecy can be achieved by lattice codes, and in fact the mutual information will vanish exponentially.\nSo far we have proven the existence of good lattice codes for strong secrecy. The ﬂatness factor actually tells more than that. From a practical perspective, we have a design criterion: Corollary 2 (Design criterion of good lattice codes for se- crecy). A lattice Λ e is good for secrecy if its ﬂatness factor ϵ Λ e is small.\nTo prove the reliability for Bob, we need a ﬁne lattice Λ b which is good for channel coding. We use a sphere-bound achieving lattice deﬁned by Forney [8], whose error probability tends to zero as long as γ b > e. It is easy to see that we may obtain any secrecy rate\nRelation to secrecy gain: A small ﬂatness factor requires a small theta series, which coincides with the criterion of secrecy gain: a large secrecy gain requires a small theta series [6].\nRelation to resolvability: In [7, 13] (see also the ear- lier works [14, 15]) a technique based on resolvability was suggested to obtain strong secrecy, which uses a binning scheme such that the bin rate is above the capacity of the eavesdropper\u2019s channel. We will show this is also the case for the proposed lattice scheme.\nIf the bin rate R \u2032 is large enough, we can approximate the average power P in (5) with the second moment per dimension σ 2 (Λ s ) (continuous approximation [16], which could be made rigorous by adding a dither [9]):\nAs was shown in [8], the capacity of the mod-Λ s channel is achieved by the uniform distribution on V(Λ s ) and is given by C(Λ s , σ 2 e ) = 1 n\n− h(Λ s , σ 2 e ) ) , where h(Λ s , σ 2 e ) is the differential entropy of the Λ s -aliased noise ¯ N n = [N n ] mod Λ. Note that if Λ s is good for quantization, the Λ s - aliased noise tends to be Gaussian, and V (Λ s ) ≈ (2πeP ) n 2 , so C(Λ s , σ 2 e ) → 1 2 log 2πeP − 1 2 log 2πeσ 2 e = 1 2 log SNR e .\nRelation to Poltyrev\u2019s setting of inﬁnite constellations: Poltyrev initiated the study of inﬁnite constellations in the presence of Gaussian noise [17]. In this setting, although the standard channel capacity is meaningless (so he deﬁned generalized capacity), the secrecy capacity is ﬁnite. This is because the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian wiretap channel as P → ∞ converges to a ﬁnite rate 1 2 log( σ 2 e σ 2\n). Lattice codes can not be better than this, so it is an upper bound. Even though we considered a mod-Λ s channel in this paper, we may enlarge V(Λ s ) (i.e., increase R \u2032 while ﬁxing R) to approach an inﬁnite constellation. It is easy to check that, given R, the upper bound on the mutual information of our proposed scheme is independent of V (Λ s ), and thus the limit exists as V (Λ s ) → ∞. This corresponds to the case of inﬁnite constellations. Further, the achieved secrecy rate is only 1 2 log 2 e away from the upper bound.\nRelation to the genuine AWGN channel: We expect that the technique developed in this paper can be extended to solve\nthe problem of the AWGN wiretap channel with a power constraint.\nThe research of L.

The authors would like to thank Damien Stehl´e and Matthieu Bloch for helpful discussions.\nIn [18], Loeliger derived a version of the Minkowski- Hlawka theorem based on the averaging over Construction- A lattices. We will adapt his method to derive the average behavior of the theta series for Construction A. Loeliger\u2019s derivation has a limitation in that it requires a function of bounded support, which is not the case for the Gaussian function associated with the theta series. This limitation will be circumvented here.\nFor integer p > 0, let Z n → Z n p : v → v be the element- wise reduction modulo-p. Following [18], consider mod-p lat- tices (Construction A) of the form Λ C {v ∈ Z n : v ∈ C}, where p is a prime and C is a linear code over Z p . In the proof, scaled mod-p lattices αΛ C {αv : v ∈ Λ C } for some α ∈ R are used. The fundamental volume of such a lattice is V (αΛ C ) = α n p n −k , where n and k are the block length and dimension of the code C, respectively. A set C of linear codes over Z p is said to be balanced if every nonzero element of Z p is contained in the same number of codes from C. In particular, the set of all linear (n, k) codes over Z p is balanced.\nLemma 3 (Average behavior of theta series). Let C be any balanced set of linear (n, k) codes over Z p . Then, for 0 < k < n and for α n p n −k = V ﬁxed,\nProof: Let f (v) = e −πy∥v∥ 2 for v ∈ R n and ﬁxed y ∈ R + , and denote by C \u2032 the set of all nonzero codewords of C.

To see this, consider any sequence α k → 0 and deﬁne f k (v) = f\n, then use Lebesgue\u2019s dominated convergence theorem, the functions f k being dominated by g(v) which is equal to 1 if v ∈\notherwise.
