It has a broad range of applications in op- erations research and communication networks. In particular, it has been believed that the design of a min-cost multicast network is equivalent to constructing a minimum Steiner tree.\nMore speciﬁcally, given the positions of n nodes in an Euclidean space R d , the minimum Steiner tree problem is to ﬁnd a min-cost network connecting the n nodes. Relay nodes can be inserted wherever desired, and a link can be drawn between any pair of nodes. An optimal solution always has a tree structure, and the cost of the tree is the total length of its edges/links. With the conventional store-and- forward principle, a minimum multicast network connecting given terminals is always a minimum Euclidean Steiner tree.\nIn a Steiner tree, every link has a unit capacity 1. With network coding, it is natural to weight the cost of a link by its capacity. The total cost of a multicast network is then its \u201cvolume\u201d: the product of capacity and distance at each link, summed over all links in the network. Li and Wu [1] show that given network coding, a min-cost multicast network is no longer necessarily a Steiner tree. Below we explain this fact with a new and simpler example.\nFig. 1 shows six terminals lying on an equilateral triangle. Nodes s 1 , s 2 , and s 3 are sources having the same information, which is requested by receivers t 1 , t 2 , and t 3 at unit rate 1 bps. A min-cost multicast network without network coding is shown in (a), which is a geometric embedding of a Steiner forest, with capacity 1 at each link. Edge length of the\nlarge equilateral triangle is 2. Fig. 1(a) shows the minimum multicast network based on network coding, with ﬂow rate 0.5 at each link. The total cost of this multicast network is 3\n3/2. Fig. 1(b) shows a minimum network based on a Steiner tree, for supporting the same multicast rate of 1 to the three receivers. Each link ﬂow rate here is 1, the three angles at each relay are all 120 ◦ . The total cost of the Steiner tree is\n7. The ratio of the two costs is\n3/2) . = 1.018. It is worth pointing out that, although the gap between tree based and network coding based multicast network costs is small, the gap reveals a fundamental difference in the underlying structure of tree based multicast and network coding based multicast in a geometric space. Consequently, these two problems may have drastically different computational complexity.\nWhile the above example includes multiple sources, it can be transformed into a single source example. As shown in Fig. 2, add a new source node s, connect s to each of s 1 , s 2 , and s 3 with a curved path where receivers are densely\ndistributed. When these new receivers are close enough to each other on the three new paths, an optimal multicast network will connect them along the three curved paths. Consequently, from the point of view of t 1 , t 2 and t 3 , s 1 , s 2 , and s 3 become information sources holding common information of interest, and we are back at the scenario in Fig. 1.\nIn this work, we concentrate on the new problem of min-cost multicast network design with network coding, in Euclidean spaces. As one of the ﬁrst work along this direction, we study basic problems including (1) what properties must an optimal multicast network have, (2) when does an optimal multicast network require and not require network coding, and (3) the computational complexity of constructing the optimal multicast network. In particular, we prove that network coding is not necessary in the basic case of 1-to-2 multicast (three terminals, including one source and two receivers). We also prove upper-bounds on the number of relay nodes required in an optimal acyclic multicast network.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present the formal formulation of the problem and develop an equivalent discrete model that is helpful in the following analysis. In Sec. III, we prove that network coding is unnecessary for the case of three terminals. In Sec. IV, we study the number of relay nodes required in an optimal acyclic multicast network. We conclude the paper and discuss open questions in Sec. V.\nLet T denote the set of n terminals and s ∈ T be the source. A network is speciﬁed by a ﬁnite directed graph D(V, A), T ⊂ V , the capacity c( → uv) of each link → uv∈ A, and the position ρ(v) of each relay node v ∈ V . A network is called a feasible multicast network if it can support a unit rate multicast session from s to each receiver t ∈ R = T \\{s}.\nThe cost of link → uv is given by the product of its capacity c( → uv) and its length | → uv |, i.e., the Euclidean distance between u and v. The cost of introducing a relay node is ignored. Hence the cost of a network is the summation of its link costs.\nThe multicast version of the space information ﬂow prob- lem, or the design of a min-cost multicast network in a geometric space, is to construct a feasible multicast network of minimum cost. With network coding, feasibility is checked by verifying whether the network can support a multicast ﬂow of unit rate. A celebrated result on network coding states that, for multicast in a directed network, a given multicast rate is feasible if it is feasible as a unicast rate to each receiver separately [3]. Let f t ( → uv) be the s-t ﬂow from u to v. The problem can be formulated as follows:\nsubject to : \t (1) ∀t ∈ R, ∀u ∈ V \t v∈V f t ( → uv) − f t ( → vu) = δ t (u)\n \n1 \t if u = s −1 if u = t\nRemarks. Note that in the geometric version of the multicast problem, the number and locations of relay nodes are not speciﬁed in the input, and the mathematical program above can not be solved using regular optimization techniques.\nWhich terminal assumes the role of the multicast source is actually not important for constructing an optimal multicast network. If the role between a receiver and the source is switched, we only need to reverse some links (or reverse parts of the link\u2019s capacity) of the original optimal multicast network to support the new multicast session [4].\nWe next transform the optimal multicast network design problem into its discrete version, which will be utilized in our later analysis.\nIn a practical network coding or routing solution, informa- tion ﬂow rates are rational numbers. We can deﬁne a unit ﬂow rate as one symbol (from a ﬁnite ﬁeld F) per unit time. Then all the information ﬂow rates and link capacities are integral. A link with capacity larger than 1 can be replaced with parallel links of unit capacity. Let D(V, A) denote such a directed network, and λ D (s, t) denote the maximum number of link- disjoint paths from s to t in D. Then with linear network coding [5], h = min t∈R λ D (s, t) symbols can be transmitted to each receiver per unit time. Therefore, the average cost for a unit rate multicast session is 1 h → uv∈A | → uv |, and the problem to ﬁnd such a min cost discrete network can be formulated as:\nsubject to : \t (2) λ D (s, t) ≥ h, ∀t ∈ R\nNote that the Euclidean Steiner tree problem can be viewed as a special case with h = 1.\nTo show that the two formulations (1) and (2) are equivalent, we only need to verify that the optimal solution of (1), if existent, can always be achieved by rational link capacities. This is true because all the coefﬁcients and constants of the linear constraints in (1) are rational. So we can scale each link\u2019s capacity with the least common multiple of their denominators to make each link\u2019s capacity integral to obtain an optimal solution of (2).\nBy deﬁnition, a solution to a space information ﬂow prob- lem has two components: a multicast network D(V, A) and an embedding (location assignment of each relay node). In this subsection, we discuss properties that an optimal embedding of a multicast network must possess. Some of these properties are utilized in our proofs in the next section.\nIn the literature of the Euclidean Steiner Tree problem [6], Gilbert and Pollak study the properties of relatively minimal\nSteiner trees. Some of such properties can be extended to the scenario of space information ﬂow. Besides the goal of minimizing total network cost, we have no constraints on the embedding, e.g., the embedding does not have to be planar even if the space is 2-D, and links may intersect.\nWe say an embedding is relatively minimal with respect to network D(V, A), if we can not reduce the overall network cost by perturbing a relay node, i.e., by changing the position of some relay node slightly. When the position of a relay node v is changed by dx, the length of link → uv is changed by → uv | → uv| · dx. If | → uv | = 0, the length is increased by |dx|. Therefore, we have the following properties:\nStable at Relay. Imagine each link of non-zero length as an elastic band with the unusual property of having unit tension regardless of how much it is stretched. For links of zero length, imagine them as glue binding the two nodes, which can provide a unit passive force at most. Suppose there is some external force at each terminal to hold its position. Then in any relatively minimal embedding, the position of each relay node is stable. In fact, the combined external force at any set of relay nodes is zero.\nConvex Hull. In any relatively minimal embedding, all relay nodes lie in the convex hull of T .\nConvexity. Let ρ 1 and ρ 2 be two embeddings of the same network, with cost C 1 and C 2 , respectively. For any p, q ≥ 0, p+q = 1, the embedding ρ = pρ 1 +qρ 2 has cost C ≤ pC 1 + qC 2 . Therefore, any relatively minimal embedding achieves the minimum cost of the given multicast network.\nUnlike in the minimum Steiner tree problem, a relay node may have more than three adjacent links in the optimal multicast network enabled by network coding. Thus some properties of the relatively minimal Steiner tree [6] do not hold for the relatively minimal embedding, because these properties depend on the assumption that a Steiner (relay) node has three non-zero length links. We translate one of these properties into a conditioned form for the optimal embedding in a plane, which is useful in our proof to the three terminals case:\nWedge Property. Let W ⊂ R 2 be any open wedge-shaped region with an angle of at least 120 ◦ (Fig. 3). In any relatively minimal embedding on a plane where each relay node has three non-zero length links, if W does not contain any terminal node, W contains no relay node [6].\nSpace information ﬂow is a new ﬁeld of research, and basic problems remain open on the design of a min-cost multicast network in a geometric space. Three important ones are listed below.\nAchievability. Given a ﬁnite set of terminals, is the minimum cost achievable with a ﬁnite network, i.e., a multicast network with a ﬁnite number of relay nodes? In the problem formula- tion, no bound is enforced on the size of a solution D(V, A). There is a possibility that no ﬁnite network is optimal, in that for any ﬁnite multicast network, there exists another network that achieves a less cost by including more relay nodes.\nBeneﬁts of network coding. How much is the difference between the cost of a minimum Steiner tree and a minimum network coding based solution? In Li and Wu\u2019s work [1] that proposes the space information ﬂow problem, such a gap is studied, with upper-bound on the gap proven for special cases. Complexity. Is there an efﬁcient (polynomial-time) algorithm that computes the optimal solution? While Euclidean Steiner Tree is a well known NP-hard problem, it is unclear whether the new problem of min-cost multicast network design in (1) is NP-hard or not. The example in Fig. 1 reveals that these two problems have different underlying structures, and may have different computational complexity.\nThese questions are indeed co-related. In this work, we present two results toward these directions. In the rest of this section, we prove that in the most basic scenario, when the input size is small (three terminals), network coding does not make a difference. This leads to an interesting contrast to the network information ﬂow case (optimal multicast in a ﬁxed, existing network), where in the well-known three- terminal butterﬂy network [3], network coding outperforms routing. In the next section, we prove that ﬁnitely many relays always sufﬁce, and present closed-form upper-bounds on the number of relays required for achieving minimum cost in acyclic networks.\nAs a basic scenario, the three terminals case is well-studied in the Euclidean Steiner tree literature. The minimum Steiner tree for 3 terminals contains at most 1 relay node of degree 3. From the Stable at Relay property, the three links must meet at the relay with three 120 ◦ angles. Such a location is called the Fermat Point. Let\u2019s deﬁne the cost advantage as the ratio of the minimum network cost without coding over that with network coding. By showing that the cost advantage is 1 for three terminals, we can see that network coding is unnecessary for this case, and the min-cost multicast network is a minimum Steiner tree.\nTheorem 1. If |T | = 3, the cost advantage is always 1. In other words, the minimum Steiner tree achieves the minimum cost, which cannot be improved by network coding.\nProof: We prove the theorem by way of contradiction. Suppose there is a conﬁguration T = {s, t 1 , t 2 } with cost\nadvantage strictly larger than 1. Then there must be a network with total cost strictly less than the cost of a minimum Steiner tree. Let D(V, A) be such a minimal network which has the minimum number of links. We will show that we can construct a network D with the same number of links and cost no more than the cost of D, while its optimal embedding has no zero length links and each relay has 3 links at most. Therefore, applying the Wedge Property concludes that all the relay nodes locate on the edge of the minimal Steiner tree, which contradicts the assumption.\nWe construct the desired topology D from D by splitting a relay node of degree larger than 3 repeatedly, while preserving the max ﬂow to each receiver. As illustrated in Fig. 4, splitting a relay node corresponds to replacing the relay node with two nodes, and dividing the adjacent links into two none empty parts connected to the two nodes respectively. Note that if such splitting exists, the total cost does not increase and there is no zero length links in the optimal embedding of D . Otherwise, we can merge the two ends of a zero length link to obtain a new topology with the same cost but less links, which conﬂicts with the fact that D has the minimum number of links. Therefore, we can obtain the desired network satisfying the condition of Wedge Property.\nLet (f 1 , f 2 ) be a max ﬂow solution for receiver t 1 and t 2 . As we are considering the discrete model, all links can be divided into three classes: (A) with ﬂow (f 1 (e), f 2 (e)) = (0, 1); (B) with ﬂow (1, 0); (C) with ﬂow (1, 1). For a relay node of degree larger than 3, if there exist an incoming link and an outgoing link belonging to the same class, we complete the splitting by connecting these two links to a new node. Otherwise, all incoming links and outgoing links belong to different classes. According to the ﬂow conversation law, it can be veriﬁed that classes A and B always belong to the same side, i.e., either incoming links belong to class A and B, and outgoing links belong to class C, or the other way around. In any case, we ﬁnd a class A link, a class B link and a class C link to complete the splitting operation.\nDiscussion. As n grows larger, eventually there will be conﬁg- urations with cost advantage strictly larger than 1. Recall that in the example illustrated in Fig. 1, six terminals are used to construct a multiple source example where cost advantage is strictly larger than 1. It is unknown whether the cost advantage can be larger than 1 for the cases n = 4 and n = 5. For\nmulticast in a network (instead of in a space), network coding starts to make a difference for three terminals already \u2014 in the butterﬂy network, there are one source and two terminals.\nIn the literature of network coding, the case of two integral ﬂows has attracted considerable research interests [7][8]. It represents the most basic scenario where network coding can make a difference from routing. For the case h = 1, we are back to multicast trees.\nIn this section, we analyze the maximum number of relay nodes that can be required in an optimal solution to the multicast problem in space. We focus on the two ﬂow case ﬁrst, and then extend our discussions to more general cases of h > 2. Once the number of relay nodes is upper bounded, the problem in (1) becomes an optimization problem of ﬁnite variables, simplifying its solution algorithm design.\nFor the case h = 1, studies on the Euclidean Steiner tree problem have shown that the minimum cost can be achieved by adding n − 2 relay nodes at most. Our result essentially generalizes the study to the case h = 2.\nBefore stating the theorem, we ﬁrst introduce the concepts of a h-minimal network and a subtree decomposition.\nWhile searching for the optimal solution, it is reasonable to consider only the h-minimal networks [9], where deleting any link will cause λ D (s, t) < h for some receiver t. According to Li, et al. [5], for any h-minimal network, there is a linear network code where each link is assigned a global coding vector from the h dimension linear space F h . Therefore in a h-minimal network, each node has in-degree at most h, since the coding vector on an extra link would be linearly dependent with the other h coding vectors and thus redundant.\nFor further analyzing the structure of a h-minimal network, Fragouli and Soljanin introduce the feasible subtree decom- position [7], which divides all the links into subtrees such that there exists a feasible coding solution with links from the same subtree allocated the same coding vector. These subtrees are classiﬁed into source subtrees, rooted at the source, and coding subtrees , rooted at non-source nodes.\nTheorem 2. When h = 2, there exists an optimal multicast network that has (2n − 3)(2n − 2) + n − 1 relay nodes at most.\nProof: Consider an optimal solution with h = 2 that has the minimum number of links. If there exists a splittable relay node, we apply the splitting operation to it. During the splitting, the cost of the network and the number of links in the network both remain unchanged, and the number of nodes increases by 1. Since the total number of nodes is upper-bounded by twice the number of links, which is not changing, sooner or later we have no more relay nodes to split. Let D(V, A) be the optimal network after such splitting. In network D, a relay node with in-degree larger than 1 must be an encoding node, since otherwise it can be splitted.\nAs an optimal solution, D must be 2-minimal. Hence each node has in-degree no more than 2. The relay nodes can be categorized into two sets: 1) inner Steiner nodes with in-degree\n1, which appear exactly once in a minimum Steiner subtree; 2) coding nodes with in-degree 2. We prove an upper-bound on the size of each set separately.\nFor the minimal subtree decomposition, we have the fol- lowing lemma:\nLemma. (C. Fragouli and E. Soljanin [7]) For minimal subtree decomposition of a 2-minimal network, each coding subtree contains at least two receivers and each source subtree con- tains at least one receiver.\nAs each receiver appears in exactly two different subtrees, the number of coding subtrees is no more than n − 1. Since a coding node is the root of at least one coding subtree, the number of coding nodes is also no more than n − 1.\nOn the other hand, each subtree is a minimum Euclidean Steiner tree connecting a subset of the n terminals and no more than n−1 coding nodes. Therefore, each subtree contains 2n − 3 inner Steiner nodes at most. According to the previous analysis, there are no more than 2(n − 1) subtrees, since each subtree contains at least one receiver node. To conclude, the number of inner Steiner nodes is upper-bounded by (2n − 3)(2n − 2).\nAcyclic networks with arbitrary h. According to the result that the number of coding nodes is upper bounded by h 3 (n − 1) 2 in an acyclic multicast network [9], we can show that the number of relay nodes is upper bounded in such networks in a similar way: in an h-minimal network, any relay node with in-degree larger than 1 must be a coding node and thus the total number of relays is bounded by h 3 (n − 1) 2 ; for the relay nodes with in-degree 1, they appear exactly once in each coding subtree. The number of coding forests, each of which is composed of coding subtrees of the same coding vector, is no more than n h , since a ﬁnite ﬁeld of size n is sufﬁcient and the number of different coding vectors is no more than n h . As each coding forest has n + h 3 (n − 1) 2 − 2 inner Steiner nodes (relay node with in-degree 1) at most, we can see that the number of relay nodes with in-degree 1 is no more than n h (n + h 3 (n − 1) 2 − 2).\nWe studied the multicast version of the space information ﬂow problem in this work, which models the design of the blueprint of a min-cost multicast network. We showed through a simple example that the design of an information network is different from that of a transportation network. We discussed a number of properties that an optimal multicast network embedding must possess. For the basic case of three multicast terminals, we prove that network coding does not make a difference, contrasting the problem of multicast in networks. We ﬁnally prove upper-bounds on the number of relay nodes required in min-cost multicast networks.\nThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant 61171074, the National S&T Major Project of China under Grant 2010ZX03003-003-03,\nProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in University under Grant NCET-11-0113.
