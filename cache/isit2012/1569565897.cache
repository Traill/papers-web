For example, the introduction of efﬁcient power control algorithms (both closed loop and open loop), was one of the main improvements third gener- ation CDMA-based cellular networks brought about. Several algorithms been developed that provably allow receivers to obtain e.g. a minimum SINR requirement SINR k ≥ γ k for link k while minimizing the total power or the power per user, subject to the feasibility of this solution [1], [2]. Importantly, power optimization remains an relevant problem in emerging and future networks. Ad hoc networks are one such class of networks, where substantial effort has been made to analyze their behavior, through metrics such as connectivity and transport capacity [3]\u2013[6].\nA number of works have discussed the feasibility conditions of the optimal power vector [5], [7] under general assumptions, without however addressing speciﬁc gains from power control. In contrast, [6] using the Laplace transform method, has calculated the effects of fading, pathloss and random erasures on the interference to a random receiver in both regular and Poisson random networks. In addition, they analyze the effects of power-control by inverting the pathloss and/or the fading coefﬁcient of the direct link of a given transmitter and receiver.\nHowever, the interference from neighboring transmitters is only taken into account by considering them as an effective medium without any feedback taken into account. Hence, the effects of the increase of power in a given link to other neighboring links, which also control their power in order to maintain a target SINR, are neglected. A similar approach is taken by [8] who introduce a scheme to compensate partially for the fading coefﬁcient of the direct link between transmitter and receiver, without addressing the effects on neighboring links. These effects were partially included in the context of percolating networks in [9]. Here however, the network is initially assumed to be percolating with all transmitters utilizing their maximum power and then the powers are reduced while keeping their connectivity. Thus the optimal power is obtained only for the links that are already connected without any guarantees to others.\nThe effect of interference is already a problem in dense WiFi networks and is expected to become an issue in the context of femto-cells, a recently proposed network paradigm, when they become massively deployed: due to their close proximity, neighboring femto-cells may create interference to one another [10]. Hence, when each transmitter increases its power in order to compensate for this interference, it may create domino effect of power increases, which needs to be addressed. As a result, all above situations are expected to beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from power optimization. Nevertheless, little progress has been made in ﬁnding analytic estimates of the performance of random, interference-limited networks when power control is applied [11].\nIn this paper we apply tools from random matrix theory, [12], [13] providing an analytic estimate of the optimal power performance for a large network in the presence of both in- terference and randomness. We start from an ordered network structure, in particular an equally spaced line (or square) of N transmitters, each with a receiver located in its neighborhood at a ﬁxed distance. Then we introduce randomness in the network by removing each transmitter-receiver pair with probability e. As a result, a network with roughly N(1 − e) transceiver pairs will remain, randomly located in the original lattice. This thinned network is a model for a realistic cellular network, which usually tries to mimic a (usually hexagonal) symmetric network. It is also a good model for a wireless network with intermittent activity, such that at any time a fraction e of the total transmitters are inactive. Although relatively\nstraightforward, this paradigm carries all the traits of a random network and, as we shall see, behaves qualitatively differently from ordered networks. Also, surprisingly these results are valid for both one-dimensional and two-dimensional networks.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section we deﬁne the network model in the absence of any randomness. In Section III we describe the network with erasures of transmitter-receiver pairs and calculate the average minimum power per receiver as well as its variance using results from random matrix theory. In Section IV we discuss the relevance of these results in both one- and two-dimensional geometries. Finally, in Section V we draw some conclusions, while in the appendix we provide some details of the proofs.\nAssume a network of N transmitters on a lattice. The lattice may be one-dimensional with equal spacing between them, or two-dimensional (see Fig. 1). In the latter case, which is obviously the more realistic one, it may have any symmetry, e.g. hexagonal or triangular, but for concreteness, we will assume that the lattice is square. Each transmitter is connected via a link to a single receiver located at a distance δ from its corresponding transmitter. The channel coefﬁcient between transmitter i and receiver j and averaged over the fading is given by\nwhere m i is the lattice vector of integers corresponding to transmitter i. For simplicity, we have normalized the channel gains to unity for i = j. It is also convenient to deﬁne s = δ/ . For d-dimensional lattices (d = 1, 2), m i can be expressed in terms of integer linear combinations of the d basis-vectors k of the lattice\nfor integer 0 ≤ m ia < L, where N = L d . Since the integers m ia fully specify the position m i , we will drop the index i when not necessary. For simplicity we assume periodic boundary conditions on the lattice, hence m a ≡ m a + L. This means that the distance between any two points is taken as their minimum distance on a toroidal geometry (or a circular geometry for one dimension). It should be emphasized that the effects of this circulant property for the matrix with elements g ij will become negligible for large N . Also, α ≥ 2 is the pathloss exponent, which signiﬁes how fast the channel strength decays as a function of distance.\nThe pathloss function above is somewhat artiﬁcial in its de- pendence on the distances between the receiver and transmit- ter. Technically, it is strictly correct only when each receiver is located vertically to the line connecting all transmitters (as in any horizontal line of Fig. 1), which is one possible geometry for one dimensional systems [7]. Nevertheless, it has the right\nbehavior for m i = m j as well as for |m i − m j | \t δ. 1 The reason we chose to use this model will become apparent later.\nƐ į\nThe receivers now connect with their own nearby cells. The SINR for each connection is given by\ng jk p j \t (3) where p k is the transmitted power from the k transmitter to the receiver k and n is the thermal noise, assumed equal for all for simplicity. For the connection to be possible, a minimum value of the SINR has to be attainable i.e.\nTherefore, each transmitter should adjust its own power to meet this criterion. As a result, the following set of equations should be simultaneously met\nThe above equations constitute a set of linear (planar) con- straints on the powers. The minimum total power is reached at the apex of the conical section of allowed powers, given by equality of all constraints above. Deﬁning the matrix M with elements M ij as\nwhere P is the vector of powers that satisﬁes the equality constraint above and J = [1, 1, . . . , 1] T . As a result, the\n1 N\nClearly, for p ave to be well-deﬁned, all the eigenvalues of M have to be positive.\nNow, due to the circulant structure of M, its eigenvectors will be Fourier modes indexed by the vector q which resides in the fundamental cell of the reciprocal lattice of the lattice m with basis vectors ˆ a\nwith −1/2 < k a ≥ 1/2 [15]. The eigenvalue corresponding to the vector q is simply the Fourier transform of any line of the matrix M given by\nIt is important to note that these eigenvalues are real because the matrix M is real and symmetric, which is the reason for choosing (1). Finally, since the vector J is proportional to the q = 0 eigenvector of M we conclude that p ave = λ −1 0 where λ 0 = λ(q = 0). This solution corresponds to all transmitters transmitting with the same power. The condition for ﬁnite total power in the case of no erasures is simply\nThe above equations are valid in the absence of erasures of transmitters. Realistically, erasures may occur in two ways. First, the transmitter in a particular location may be absent. Therefore, no mobile is expected to receive any data in that cell. Second, when the buffer to a particular receiver may be empty for a period of time. Hence the corresponding trans- mitter will be silent. In principle, it may still be transmitting a pilot signal, in which case the required SINR will be much smaller. For simplicity, we will assume that the connection to its cell-receiver(s) will be off. As a result, for every transmitter- receiver pair that is \u201coff\u201d we need to set both its column and row elements to zero. Since this pair is chosen at random, we need to set each column-row pair to zero with probability e. This can be done by modifying the matrix to\nwhere E is a diagonal random matrix with independent diagonal entries e i on the ith entry, with\nP [e i = 0] = e \t (13) P [e i = 1] = 1 − e\nwhere we have erased the corresponding entries from J on the left-hand-side by multiplying with E. Now, simply inverting the matrix M e is problematic, since it has approximately N e zero columns and rows and corresponding zero eigenvalues. Instead, we regularize the matrix by adding a small positive constant on the diagonal, namely\nTo obtain the average power as before we multiply on the left with J \u2020 E to collect all the components with non-zero power. Thus we have\n1 N\nTheorem 1 (Average Minimum Power). Let β be the solution of the equation\nwhere λ (q) is the q eigenvalue of the matrix M (10) and the integral is over the fundamental cell of the reciprocal lattice of the system. Then when N → +∞ the average power per transmitter converges almost surely to\nβ + λ 0 \t (18) Remark 1.1. In the appendix the above theorem is proved for one-dimensional lattices. We will conjecture that this is valid for two-dimensional lattices and for all feasible γ through simulations and defer the complete proof for a longer version of the work.\nIt is easy to see that the above result reduces to p ave = 1/λ 0 in the limit that e → 0. Indeed, when λ 0 > 0, the right-hand- side of (17) is zero only when β = 0. Similarly, for e → 1 the average power takes its non-interference value\nIn the presence of erasures, the maximum SINR target that is supported in the system is reduced to\nwhere β e is the solution of (17) and γ is given by the equality of (11).\nIn addition to the mean power, we can also obtain the variance of the powers in the network given by\nTheorem 2 (Variance of Minimum Power). The variance of the powers of the individual transmitters in the network is given by\nWe start by analyzing the results for the simpler one- dimensional case, where the transmitters are located in a ring. The numerical results are plotted in Fig. 2. There we see, both analytically and numerically, that the average power is ﬁnite for a range of γ above the value for which λ 0 = 0, which is the value of γ for which the e = 0 solution diverges. Interestingly, when γ is such that λ 0 < 0 a second solution to the ﬁxed point equation appears (plotted, for the case of α = 4 in Fig. 2 as dashed line for e = 0.7)). This second solution of p ave is an artifact of the solution and persists until it merges with the physical value at a critical value of γ. At that point the variance of the average power vector diverges (see dotted line in 2). Beyond this point no ﬁnite average power can be supported for the given value of e. We thus see a discontinuous transition at that point, from a ﬁnite average minimum power to an inﬁnite (infeasible) value. This, combined with the fact the variance of the power vector diverges at this point, suggests that either a ﬁnite number of transmitter powers diverge, or that there is a heavy tail in the distribution of transmitter powers in the optimal power vector.\nAnother interesting result from the numerical analysis is that beyond the value of γ where λ 0 = 0 the behavior becomes sample dependent. Thus the value at which the power becomes\ninﬁnite varies somewhat from sample to sample (as well as the whole curve beyond the value where λ 0 = 0). As we shall show in the appendix, the end point of this curve has to do with the largest eigenvalue of the matrix EME. For ﬁnite but large N it is known for similar random matrix systems [16] that although the eigenvalues of the matrix converge fast to their asymptotic spectrum, the largest eigenvalue ﬂuctuates much more outside the support of the asymptotic spectrum. Hence, while the theoretical curve seems to be the upper limit, beyond which no ﬁnite power can be supported, this ﬁnite size behavior, which can be seen in the numerically obtained curves in Fig. 2 seems to be due to the ﬂuctuations of the largest eigenvalue. How can we explain this behavior? Presumably, if a region happens to have a large concentration of transmitters it may create a situation where the power of a particular transmitter diverges.\nIt is remarkable that these results also hold for two- dimensional lattices, even though we have not provided a proof in this short paper version. This can be seen in Fig. 3. We once again observe the same behavior as in the one-dimensional case.\nIn this paper we have studied the optimal power vector that achieves an SINR target criterion in a wireless network setting where both randomness and interference are relevant. We have applied methods from Random Matrix Theory to obtain the average optimum power and its variance. Our numerical results show remarkable agreement with predicted analytical calculations, both for one- and two-dimensional network geometries. These metrics can provide an indication for the power requirements such a network would have. We\nalso observe that in the presence of randomness the optimal power does not go to inﬁnity in a continuous fashion. Rather, a discontinuity occurs at a certain point, beyond which no ﬁnite power solution exists. At the same time, the variance of the power vector diverges at that point, suggesting that only a small minority of transmitting powers becomes unbounded. As a result, accepting the loss of these connections, which would only result to a small outage in the connectivity, would signiﬁcantly improve the network performance.\nBoth proofs will be assume one-dimensional networks. The case of d = 2 is deferred to a longer publication.\nProof of Theorem 1: We start by deﬁning the matrix A = EF, where F is the Fourier matrix that diagonalizes M = F \u2020 ΛF and denote its column vectors by a q and, in particular, a 0 = N −1/2 EJ. As a result, (16) may be rewritten as\nwhere Λ 0 is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of M with the one corresponding to q = 0 (i.e. λ 0 ) set to zero. After the application of the matrix inversion lemma we obtain\nβ ( ) + λ 0 \t (24) where\nIn [13] it is shown that the above quantity takes (a.s.) a deterministic value in the large N limit, which is the solution of the following equation\nTaking the limit → 0 + in the above and setting β (0) = β concludes the proof.\nProof of Theorem 2: We start by noting that the normal- ized second moment of the power vector P is given by\n= 1 1 − e lim →0 + a \u2020 0 [EME + I] −2 a 0 \t (27) = − 1 1 − e lim →0 + ∂ ∂ a \u2020 0 [EME + I] −2 a 0 = 1 1 − e lim →0 + β ( ) (β( ) + λ\nwhere β ( ), the derivative of β( ) with respect to can be evaluated directly from (26). Subtracting off p 2 ave concludes the proof.\nIt is interesting to point out that the condition that the denominator in (22) vanishes, which signiﬁes the end of the feasibility of a solution, is equivalent to the largest edge of the asymptotic spectrum of the matrix EME becoming zero and hence the point when β can no longer admit a real solution. To show this we start from the fact that Λ and FEF \u2020 are\nasymptotically free [13]. Then, deﬁning the Cauchy transform as\ne z\nwhere η is the η transform of the matrix [17]. Taking advantage of the above-mentioned asymptotic freedom [13], [17] we can show that\nIndeed, identifying e/F (0) as β we see that if z = 0 is not part of the asymptotic spectrum, β has a real solution in the above equation, which coincides with (17). On the other hand, when z = 0 is inside the support of the spectrum, β will also have an imaginary part. At the edge of the spectrum the condition ImF (z edge ) = 0 implies"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"G. J. Foschini"},{"name":"Z.
