Speciﬁcally, when a genie provides the receiver with perfect channel state information (the so called coherent setting), the capacity of a multiple-antenna fading channel grows linearly in the minimum between the number of transmit and receive antennas [1]. In practice, however, the fading channel is not known a priori at the receiver and must be estimated. Lack of a priori channel knowledge at the receiver determines a capacity loss compared to the coherent case. This loss, which depends on the rate at which the fading channel varies in time, frequency, and space [2]\u2013[5], can be characterized in a fundamental way by studying capacity in the noncoherent setting where neither the transmitter nor the receiver are assumed to have a priori knowledge of the realizations of the fading channel (but both are assumed to know its statistics perfectly). In the remainder of the paper, we will refer to capacity in the noncoherent setting simply as capacity.\nFor frequency-ﬂat fading channels, a simple model to capture channel variations in time is the Rayleigh block-fading model according to which the channel remains constant over a block of T ≥ 1 symbols and changes independently from block to\nblock. The parameter T can be thought of as the channel\u2019s coherence time. Even if the capacity of the Rayleigh block- fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel has been studied extensively in the literature [2], [6], [3], [7], no closed- form capacity expression is available to date. Zheng and Tse [3] showed that the capacity C grows as\nand N standing for the number of transmit and receive antennas, respectively, and O(1) indicates a bounded function of ρ (for sufﬁciently large ρ). The capacity expression (1) implies that, at high SNR, the capacity loss due to lack of a priori channel knowledge is large when the channel\u2019s coherence time T is small. It also implies that at high SNR, the capacity-maximizing number of transmit antennas M (for ﬁxed T and a ﬁxed number of receive antennas N ) is min {N, T/2 }.\nWhen T ≥ M + N (channel\u2019s coherence time larger or equal to the total number of antennas), the high-SNR expression (1) can be tightened as follows [3, Sec. IV.B]\nHere, o (1) → 0 as ρ → ∞, and c, which is given in [3, Eq. (24)], depends on T , M , and N but not on ρ. Differently from (1), the high-SNR expression (2) describes capacity accurately already at moderate SNR values [7], [8] because it captures the ﬁrst two terms in the asymptotic expansion of capacity for ρ → ∞. The key element exploited in [3] to establish (2) is the optimality of isotropically distributed unitary input signals [2, Sec. A.2] at high SNR; the isotropic unitary input distribution is often referred to as unitary space-time modulation (USTM) [9], [7].\nIn this paper, we shall focus on the case T < M +N (channel\u2019s coherence time smaller than the total number of antennas), which is of interest for communication systems using large antenna arrays. The use of large antenna arrays in MIMO systems (large- MIMO systems) has been recently advocated to reduce energy consumption in wireless networks, to combat the effect of small- scale fading, and to release multi-user MIMO gains with limited\nco-operation among base stations and low complexity channel estimation algorithms [10]\u2013[12].\nContributions: We prove that in the large-MIMO setting where T < M + N , USTM is not capacity-achieving at high SNR. We show that the capacity-achieving input signal is the product of a unitary isotropically distributed random matrix, and a diagonal matrix whose nonzero entries are distributed as the square-root of the eigenvalues of a Beta-distributed random matrix of appropriate size. Utilizing this input distribution, which we refer to as Beta-variate space-time modulation (BSTM), we extend (2) to the case T < M + N . The use of BSTM instead of USTM when N T turns out to yield a rate gain larger than 10% at moderate SNR values.\nNotation: Uppercase boldface letters denote matrices and lowercase boldface letters designate vectors. The superscripts T and H stand for transposition and Hermitian transposition, re- spectively. We denote the identity matrix of dimension M × M\nby I M , and diag {a} is the diagonal square matrix whose main diagonal contains the entries of the vector a. The distribution of a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian random vector with covariance matrix Σ is denoted by CN (0, Σ); Gamma(·, ·) is the Gamma distribution, and Beta( ·, ·) denotes the Beta distri- bution [13]. Finally, log( ·) indicates the natural logarithm, and Γ( ·) denotes the Gamma function.\nWe consider a Rayleigh block-fading MIMO channel with M transmit antennas, N receive antennas, and channel\u2019s coherence time T . The channel input-output relation within a coherence in- terval can be compactly written in matrix notation as follows [6], [7], [3]:\nHere, X ∈ C T ×M contains the signal transmitted from the M antennas within the coherence interval, H ∈ C M ×N is the channel\u2019s propagation matrix, W ∈ C T ×N is the additive noise, and Y ∈ C T ×N contains the signal received at the N antennas within the coherence interval. We will assume throughout the paper that M ≤ min{N, T/2 }. The random matrices H and W are independent of each other and have independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) CN (0, 1) entries. We consider the noncoherent setting where neither the transmitter nor the receiver have a priori knowledge of the realizations of H and W, but both know their statistics perfectly.\nWe assume that H and W take on independent realiza- tions over successive coherence intervals. Under this block- memoryless assumption, the ergodic capacity of the channel in (3) is given by\nThe supremum is over all probability distributions Q X on X that satisfy the average-power constraint\nSince the variance of the entries of H and W is normalized to one, (5) implies that ρ in (3) can be interpreted as the SNR at each receive antenna. Throughout the paper, we will often use the following additional quantities: Q = min {N, T − M}, R = max {N, T − M}, P = min{N, T }, and L = max{N, T }.\nThe main result of this paper is Theorem 1 below, which pro- vides a high-SNR characterization of C(ρ) that generalizes (2), in that it holds also in the large-MIMO setting T < M + N .\nTheorem 1: The capacity C(ρ) of the MIMO Rayleigh block- fading channel (3) with N receive antennas, coherence time T , and M ≤ min{N, T/2 } transmit antennas is given by\nHere, Γ m (a) = π m(m−1)/2 m k=1 Γ(a − k + 1) is the complex multivariate Gamma function.\nProof: The proof, which is omitted for space limitations and can be found in [14, Sec. IV], exploits the geometric structure in the input-output relation (3) ﬁrst observed in [3]. The tools used to establish (6) are, however, different from the ones used in [3]. In particular, differently from [3], our proof is based on the duality approach [4], and a novel closed-form characterization of the probability density function (pdf) of the channel output Y in (3), which generalizes a previous result obtained in [7]. These two tools allow us not only to generalize (2) to the large-MIMO setting T < M + N , but also to simplify the corresponding derivation, compared to the one provided in [3] for the case T ≥ M + N. An outline of the proof for the single- input multiple-output (SIMO) case, which sheds light on the structure of the capacity-achieving input distribution, is provided in Section III-C.\nFor the case T ≥ M + N, the high-SNR capacity expres- sion (6) coincides with the one reported in [3, Sec. IV.B]. 1 In this case, USTM, i.e., setting X =\nisotropically distributed, achieves (6). When T < M + N , the novel high-SNR capacity characterization provided in Theorem 1 implies that USTM is not capacity-achieving at high SNR, as formalized in the following corollary.\nCorollary 2: The rate achievable using USTM over the MIMO Rayleigh block-fading channel (3) with N receive an- tennas, coherence time T , and M ≤ min{N, T/2 } transmit antennas is given by\nNote that l = c when T ≥ M + N; however, l < c when T < M + N .\nWe next present a sketch of the proof of Theorem 1. Our aim is to provide an intuitive explanation on why USTM is not capacity- achieving at high SNR when T < M + N , and to explain why the matrix-variate Beta distribution arises in this case. We recall that a complete proof of Theorem 1 can be found in [14, Sec. IV]. For simplicity, we shall focus in this section on the SIMO case ( M = 1), for which the input-output relation (3) reduces to Y = √ρ xh T + W. Here, h ∼ CN (0, I N ), and x ∈ C T is subject to the average-power constraint E x 2 ≤ T . We need to show that (see Theorem 1)\nAs the capacity-achieving distribution is isotropic [2, Thm. 2], we shall assume, without loss of optimality, that x is isotropically distributed. To establish (9), we analyze separately the two differential entropy terms in the deﬁnition of mutual information\nNote that Y is conditionally Gaussian given x. Hence, the second term on the right-hand side (RHS) of (10) is given by\nh(Y | x) = N E log ρ x 2 + 1 + N T log(πe) = N log(ρ) + N E log x 2\nTo compute h(Y), we observe that, in the absence of additive noise W, the columns of Y are collinear with x and, hence, Y has rank 1. Once Gaussian noise is added, Y becomes full rank. However, because a rank- 1 matrix of dimension T × N is characterized by T + N − 1 parameters, the remaining T N − (T + N − 1) = (T − 1)(N − 1) parameters describing Y must contain information about the additive noise only in the ρ → ∞ limit. Hence, we expect that\u2014for an appropriate choice of the input distribution\u2014 h(Y) should grow as (T + N − 1) log(ρ).\nTo establish this result, it is convenient to express Y in terms of its singular value decomposition (SVD). Speciﬁcally, we write Y as\nHere, U ∈ C T ×P and V ∈ C N ×P (recall that P = min {N, T }) are (truncated) unitary matrices and Σ = diag [σ 1 · · · σ P ] T\ncontains the singular values of Y arranged in decreasing order; u 1 and v 1 stand for the ﬁrst column of U and V, respec- tively; U ∈ C T ×(P −1) and V ∈ C N ×(P −1) contain the remaining columns of U and V, respectively; ﬁnally, Σ = diag [σ 2 · · · σ P ] T . To make the SVD unique, we shall assume that the ﬁrst entry of u 1 and the diagonal entries of U are real and nonnegative [15, Sec. IV.5]. Let now P u = [u 1 P u ] where P u ∈ C T ×(T −1) is a deterministic function of u 1 chosen so that P u is a T × T unitary matrix. Similarly, let P v = [v 1 P v ] where P v ∈ C N ×(N −1) is a deterministic function of v 1 chosen so that P v is a N × N unitary matrix. By construction, we have that\nwhere Y = P H u UΣV H P v ∈ C (T −1)×(N −1) . The transforma- tion Y → (σ 1 , u 1 , v 1 , Y) is one-to-one by construction, and its Jacobian J( ·) can be easily obtained from the Jacobian of the SVD given in [3, App. A]:\nwith L = max {T, N}. We next compute h(Y) in the coordinate system induced by the transformation 2 Y → (σ 1 , u 1 , v 1 , Y)\nHere, the equality follows from the isotropic nature of the distribution of x, which implies that u 1 is independent of v 1 , and (u 1 , v 1 ) is independent of (σ 1 , Y). Furthermore [14, Sec. IV.B]\nWe now exploit the escape-to-inﬁnity property of the capacity- achieving distribution [14, Lem. 2], which implies that (see [14, Lem. 12 and Lem. 13])\nE log J (σ 1 , . . . , σ P ) \t (14) = (2N + 2T − 3) E[log( h · x )]\nSubstituting (13) and (14) into (12), and then (11) and (12) into (10), we get\nTo conclude the proof, we need to determine the distribution on x that maximizes (15). To solve this problem, it is convenient\nto operate one more transformation. Let g = h · x · ˆg, where ˆ g is taken uniformly distributed on the unit sphere in C Q (recall that Q = min {N, T − M}) and independent of x and h. By using polar coordinates, we can relate h( h · x ) and h(g) as follows [4, Lem. 6.17]\nSubstituting (16) into (15) yields I(x; Y)\nNote that maximizing the RHS of (15) amounts to maximizing the second and the third term on the RHS of (17). We next analyze these two terms separately.\nFor the second term on the RHS of (17), we note that, as E g 2 = E h 2 · x 2 ≤ T N, then\nwith equality achieved if g = ( h · x · ˆg) ∼ CN 0, T N Q I Q , or, equivalently, if\nNow note that h 2 ∼ Gamma(N, 1). Hence, for the case Q = N , we can attain (19) by setting x 2 = T with probability one (w.p.1). When Q = T − 1, however, we need to choose\nx 2 = T N ˜ d 2 /(T − 1) with ˜ d 2 ∼ Beta(T − 1, N + 1 − T ) to fulﬁll (19). This follows from Lemma 3 below, which is a special case of Lemma 6 in Section III-D.\nLemma 3: Let u ∼ Beta(p, n) with p, n ≥ 0; let also r ∼ Gamma(p + n, 1) independent of u. Then (u · r) ∼ Gamma(p, 1).\nFor the third term on the RHS of (17), we note that, as T − Q − 1 ≥ 0, Jensen\u2019s inequality yields\nEquality in (20) is achieved if x 2 = T w.p.1, or if Q = T − 1, in which case both sides of (20) vanish.\nSummarizing, when T ≥ N + 1, it is sufﬁcient to take x 2 = T w.p.1 to achieve equality in (18) and (20). As x was\ntaken isotropically distributed, the resulting input distribution is USTM. However, when T < N + 1, USTM is no longer optimal: achieving equality in (18) and (20) requires taking [(T − 1) x 2 /(T N )] ∼ Beta(T − 1, N + 1 − T ). Substitut- ing (18) and (20) in (17) and dividing by T yields (9).\nMatrix-variate distributions: We are now ready to describe the input distribution that achieves (6) for the general MIMO case. The following preliminary results from multivariate statistics will be needed.\nDeﬁnition 4: An m × m random matrix A is said to have the complex Wishart distribution with n > 0 degrees of freedom and covariance matrix Σ if A = BB H , where the columns of the m × n matrix B are independent and CN (0, Σ)-distributed. In this case, we shall write A ∼ W m (n, Σ).\nNote that when m > n, the matrix A is singular and, hence, does not admit a pdf. In this case, the probability distribution on A is sometimes referred to as pseudo-Wishart or singular Wishart . When m = 1, the Wishart distribution reduces to the Gamma distribution.\nDeﬁnition 5: An m × m random matrix C is said to have a complex matrix-variate Beta distribution of parameters p > 0 and n > 0 if C can be written as C = T H −1 AT −1 , where A ∼ W m (p, Σ) and B ∼ W m (n, Σ) are independent, and A + B = T H T, with T upper-triangular with positive diagonal elements (Cholesky factorization). In this case, we shall write C ∼ Beta m (p, n).\nLet C ∼ Beta m (p, n) with p ≥ m > 0 and n > 0. The pdf of the ordered eigenvalues λ 1 > · · · > λ m of C takes on two different forms according to the value of n. If n ≥ m, then\nIf 0 < n < m, the eigenvalues of C are distributed as follows λ 1 = . . . = λ m−n = 1 w.p.1, and\nThe following lemma generalizes Lemma 3 to matrix-variate distributions\nLemma 6: Let S ∼ W m (p + n, Σ) with m > 0, n > 0, and p ≥ m. Furthermore, let C ∼ Beta m (p, n) be independent of S. Finally, put S = T H T, where T is upper-triangular with positive diagonal elements. Then, A = T H CT ∼ W m (p, Σ).\nProof: The theorem follows from a generalization to the complex case of [16, Thm. 3.3.1] for the nonsingular case n ≥ m, and of [17, Thm. 1] for the singular case 0 < n < m.\nThe Optimal Input Distribution: Similarly to the SIMO case (see Section III-C), the capacity-achieving distribution for the general MIMO case takes on two different forms according to the relation between T, M , and N . Speciﬁcally, one should take X = ΦD where Φ is unitary and isotropically distributed, and\nD = T N /Q · D with D being a diagonal matrix whose ordered positive entries { ˜ d 1 , . . . , ˜ d M } are distributed as follows:\na) Case T < M + N : The squared nonzero entries { ˜ d 2 1 , . . . , ˜ d 2 M } of D have the same joint pdf as the ordered eigenvalues of a positive-deﬁnite M × M random matrix G ∼ Beta M (T −M, M +N −T ). The resulting pdf of { ˜ d 2 1 , . . . , ˜ d 2 M } is obtained by setting p = T − M and n = M + N − T in (21) if T ≤ N, and in (22) if N < T < M + N.\nb) Case T ≥ M + N: The nonzero entries { ˜ d 1 , . . . , ˜ d M } of D should be taken so that ˜ d 1 = · · · = ˜ d M = 1 w.p.1. This results in the USTM distribution used in [3].\nWe shall denote by Q opt D the probability distribution of D we have just introduced, and refer to the probability distribution on X = ΦD resulting by choosing Φ unitary and isotropically distributed, and D ∼ Q opt D as BSTM. Note that BSTM reduces to USTM when T ≥ M + N.\nThe use of USTM is motivated by several practical consid- erations [6], [7], [18]. Is it then worth to replace USTM by the capacity-achieving BSTM in the large-MIMO setting? In this section, we shall investigate the rate gain that results from the use of BSTM instead of USTM when T < M + N .\nAsymptotic Analysis: In Corollary 7 below we show that the rate gain resulting from using BSTM instead of USTM grows logarithmically in the number of receive antennas.\nProof: The proof is omitted for space limitations and can be found in [14, Sec. III.C].\nNumerical Results: Let C(ρ) be the high-SNR approxi- mation of C(ρ) obtained by neglecting the o(1) term in (6). Similarly, let L(ρ) be the high-SNR approximation of L(ρ) obtained by neglecting o (1) in (8). As can be inferred from the results reported in [3], [7], [8], L(ρ) is a good approxima- tion for L(ρ) when ρ 20 dB. Numerical evidence suggests that the same holds for C(ρ) and C(ρ). To illustrate the gain resulting from the use of BSTM instead of USTM for a ﬁnite (but large) number of receive antennas, we plot in Fig. 1 the ratio [C(ρ) − L(ρ)]/L(ρ) for different values of T and N, when ρ = 30 dB and M = min { T/2 , N}. We observe from Fig. 1 that the rate gain resulting from the use of BSTM instead of USTM becomes signiﬁcant when the number of receive antennas N is much larger than the channel\u2019s coherence time T . For example, when N = 100 and T = 10, the rate gain amounts to 13%. However, when T = N = 100 the rate gain is below 3%."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"I. E.
