Simultaneously, the energy transfer can be used as a vehicle for information transmission. This is a fundamental technology for near-ﬁeld passive radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) applications as well as lightweight sensor applications. In the passive RFID application, a reader, containing or attached to a power source, controls and powers a communication session with a tag; a device without a separate power source. The purpose of the communication session may be, for examples, object identiﬁcation, access control, or acquisition of sensor data.\nA simpliﬁed view of the reader-to-tag channel can be seen in Fig. 1. In more detail, an information source generates k bits of information u = (u 1 , . . . , u k ), which are passed through an encoder to produce an encoded frame c = (c 1 , . . . , c n ). The encoded frame is interpreted as a waveform that modulates a carrier wave [1]. At the receiver (or tag) side, the demodulator in the tag samples the physical waveform at time intervals determined by the tag\u2019s timing device, and converts it into an estimate ˆ c = (ˆ c 1 , . . . , ˆ c n ) of the transmitted frame, where in general n = n. A decoder at the tag subsequently attempts to recover an estimate ˆ u = (ˆ u 1 , . . . , ˆ u k ) of u from ˆ c. In the literature, different channel models have been proposed to incorporate the effects of timing errors in the reader- to-tag channel. In particular, in [2], a bit-shift model was introduced, and later in [3] a discretized Gaussian shift model was proposed. In both papers, simple modulation codes with\nsome error-correcting/avoiding properties were constructed as well. The capacity of the discretized Gaussian shift channel from [3] was considered in [4].\nIn [5], wireless information and power transfer across a noisy inductively coupled channel was considered from a different perspective, i.e., it was not considered from the perspective of timing errors and code design, but from a circuit perspective. In particular, the power transfer efﬁciency func- tion, deﬁned as the fraction of the total available power and the delivered power as a function of frequency, has a peak around a speciﬁc frequency (depending on the circuit parameters). Thus, to transfer as much power as possible, we could transmit a single sinusoid at the frequency that maximizes the power transfer efﬁciency function. Obviously, such a strategy will not work from the perspective of information transfer, since a sinusoid of a ﬁxed frequency has zero bandwidth and will therefore provide zero communication rate.\nIn this work, we will compute the power spectral density of two of the codes (and one runlength constraint) from [3] and look into their suitability from the perspective provided in [5], i.e., are they good for power transfer? Two new codes are also presented. We remark that the codes (and the runlength constraints) in [2], [3] were also designed considering power transfer. In particular, the codes were designed to be unbal- anced , i.e., there will be more ones than zeros in the encoded\nsequences. The rationale behind this construction principle was the fact that amplitude modulation was assumed. Thus, a one (resp. a zero) was transmitted by the presence (resp. absence, or alternatively a low amplitude) of the carrier for the duration speciﬁed for transmitting that particular bit. In this work, however, we will abandon this restriction and consider traditional binary phase-shift keying (BPSK).\nLet {b i } denote a binary sequence, and let A i = 1 − 2b i . The sequence {A i } is the BPSK-modulated version of {b i }. In the following, we assume that the sequence {A i } is wide- sense-stationary. The spectrum (in the D-domain) of a wide- sense-stationary (discrete-time) process {A i } is\nwhere E[·] denotes statistical expectation. To compute the power spectral density, we use D = e j2πf T , where j =\n−1, f is the frequency, and T is the symbol period. Now, when signaling with the pulse shape P T (t) where\nAlso, in [6], a procedure to compute the power spectrum of a runlength limited code (under BPSK modulation) was outlined. In particular, the power spectral density in (1) can be computed using a process {X i } deﬁned by X i = 1/2 · (A i − A i−1 ). The relationship between S X (D) and S A (D) is\nwhich follows directly from the deﬁnition of the sequence {X i }. In Theorem 1 in [6], a formula is given to compute S X (D) based on the one-step transition matrix G(D) of a runlength state diagram of the code that generates the binary sequence {b i }. In [6], the codes are used in differential mode, and thus the procedure for generating the runlength state diagram is different from the procedure that we will use in this paper. In particular, if the code under consideration can be described by a state diagram, the procedure to construct a corresponding runlength state diagram is as follows:\n1) Insert intermediate states such that each edge is labeled by a single bit.\n2) Perform state splitting such that all edges coming into (resp. leaving) a given state have the same label. Such a state diagram is called a destined state diagram [7].\n3) Perform state merging to simplify the resulting state diagram. State merging of two states can be performed if the output edge structure is identical.\n4) Transform the state diagram into a runlength state dia- gram by removing all states with the property that the incoming bit (which is the same on all incoming edges) and the outgoing bit (which is also the same on all outgoing edges) are the same. For details, see [6] or Example 1 below.\nNow, from [6, Theorem 1], it follows that S X (D) =\nwhere u = (1, 1, . . . , 1), (·) T is the transpose of its argument, I is the L × L identity matrix, L is the number of states in the runlength state diagram, π = (π 1 , . . . , π L ) is the solution to πG(1) = π, p(1) = πG (1)u T −1 , and G (D) is the element-wise derivative of G(D) with respect to D.\nThe existence of discrete components in the power spectrum deserves special attention. In fact, the existence of discrete components is closely related to the roots of the polynomial det(I + G(D)) [6]. In particular, if this polynomial has roots on the unit circle there will be discrete components in the power spectrum. For details, we refer the interested reader to [6]. See also [8].\nIn a recent paper [3], different constraints on the encoded sequence were proposed. These constraints were constructed to improve the error-rate performance on a discretized Gaus- sian shift channel. In particular, a speciﬁc binary runlength limitation denoted by RLL(L 0 , L 1 ), where L b is the set of admissible runlengths of binary symbol b, was introduced. In the rest of this section, we will consider two of the codes (and one runlength constraint) from [3], as well as two new codes (in Examples 3 and 4), through a series of examples organized into three subsections.\nIn this subsection, we consider a three-state, rate-1/2 code from [3] and the Manchester code (also considered in [3]) in more detail.\nExample 1. A three-state, rate- 1/2 encoder for a RLL ({1, 3}, {1, 3})-constrained code (taken from Example 3 in [3]) is depicted in Fig. 2. The corresponding runlength state diagram (constructed using the procedure above) is given in Fig. 3(d), and the one-step transition matrix is\n    \n0 \t D/2 \t 0 \t 0 \t D/2 D 3 /2 \t 0 \t D/2 0 \t 0\n    \nIn particular, Fig. 3(a) illustrates the ﬁrst step in the con- struction, i.e., the insertion of intermediate states in the state\ndiagram from Fig. 2 such that each edge is labeled by a single bit. In Fig. 3(b), several states have been split in order to have all incoming and outgoing edges labeled with the same bit. The state diagram in Fig. 3(c) is obtained from the state diagram in Fig. 3(b) by merging the states labeled \u201cE\u201d and \u201cF\u201d. Finally, in Fig. 3(d), the resulting runlength state diagram is depicted. For the one-step transition matrix in (4), π = (1/7, 3/14, 1/7, 3/14, 2/7) and p(1) = 7/12. Now,\n5 + 3D 4 − 21D 3 − 36D 2 + 30D + 146 (D + 1)\nwhere the denominator of the ﬁrst term has a single root on the unit circle and the denominator of the second term has no such roots. Using (2) and (3), we get (for the continuous part)\n3 + 6D 2 + 6D + 4 D 3 (1 + 2D 2 )(D 2 + 2)\nThe discrete part of the spectrum will consist of spectral lines at frequencies ±1/2, which follows from the root of the denominator of the ﬁrst term.\nExample 2. The Manchester code is a very simple block code that maps 0 into 01, and 1 into 10. The power spectral density for this code is known and can be found, for instance, in [9]. In particular, using our notation\nThe code from Example 1 is slightly statistically un- balanced, in the sense that with random uniform input, it\ntends to contain more ones than zeros. It also satisﬁes the RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})-constraint. See Example 3 in [3] for further details. Below, in Example 3, we propose a new RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})-constrained code which is statistically balanced.\nExample 3. A two-state RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})-constrained code is deﬁned as follows: A 0/10 −−−→ A, A 1/10 −−−→ B, B 0/00 −−−→ A, and B 1/11 −−−→ A, where A and B denote the two states. The code is designed to be statistically balanced and has the following one-step transition matrix for the runlength state diagram:\n  \n0 \t 0 D 3 /2 D 3 /2 D \t 0 \t 0 \t 0\n  \nfrom which it follows that π = (3/8, 1/8, 1/4, 1/4) and p(1) = 2/3. Now,\n5 + D 4 − D 3 − 9D 2 − 8D − 32 (D + 1)(D 2 + 2)\nwhere the denominator of the ﬁrst term has a single root on the unit circle and the denominator of the second term has no such roots. Using (2) and (3), we get (for the continuous part)\n= 1 6\n6 + 4D 5 + 5D 4 + 14D 3 + 5D 2 + 4D + 2 D(D 2 + 2)(1 + 2D 2 )\nThe discrete part of the spectrum will consist of spectral lines at frequencies ±1/2, which follows from the root of the denominator of the ﬁrst term.\nThe RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})-constraint has capacity larger than 1/2 [3]. Thus, we can use some of the capacity gap to impose an extra condition on the output sequences. The RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})-constraint with the additional constraint that the running digital sum (i.e., the absolute value of the number of ones minus the number of zeros) is limited to 3 has a capacity of only 0.478, so we can not ﬁnd a rate-1/2 en- coder for such a constraint. However, the RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})- constraint with the additional constraint that the running digital sum is limited to 5 has a capacity larger than 1/2. Thus, it should be possible to ﬁnd a rate-1/2 encoder. This constraint and the corresponding encoders will also have a spectral null at f = 0, i.e., they will be dc-free. Such a code has been designed and is given in Example 4 below.\nExample 4. A 12-state dc-free RLL ({1, 3}, {1, 3})- constrained code, depicted in Fig. 4, has a 21 × 21 one-step transition matrix. We omit the presentation of the matrix due to space limitations. Now, π (I + G(D)) −1 u T =\n5 8\nfor this code (details are omitted). Note that the denominator of the ﬁrst term has a single root on the unit circle, while the denominator of the third term has no such roots. Using (2) and (3), we get the expression shown at the top of the next page for S c A (D) (the continuous part of the spectrum). The discrete part of the spectrum will consist of spectral lines at frequencies ±1/2, which follows from the root of the denominator of the ﬁrst term.\nIn this subsection, we will consider the RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})- constraint from [3] in more detail in Example 5 below.\nExample 5. Without loss of generality, let α denote the combined probability of a runlength of a single one or a single zero, from which it follows that 1 − α is the combined probability of a runlength of three ones or zeros. In this case, the runlength state diagram consists of a single state, and the corresponding one-step transition matrix is\nfrom which it follows that π = (1) and p(1) = 1/(3 − 2α). Now,\nwhere the denominator of the second term has a single root on the unit circle (for any α), while the denominator of the ﬁrst term has no such roots. Thus, there are discrete spectral lines at frequencies ±1/2. Using (2) and (3), we get (for the continuous part)\nIn this section, we consider the total power transferred from the reader to the tag. We use the model proposed in [5], where the channel transfer function (in the Fourier domain) is given by\nwhere f is the frequency, M is the mutual inductance between the reader and the tag, and r l , c l , and L 2 are the load (i.e., on the tag side) resistance, capacitance, and inductance, respectively. See Equation (20) in [5] for details. Furthermore, in [1], it was shown that the mutual inductance M decreases as a function of the inter-coil separation. See Equation (11) in [1] for details. Thus, using the expressions for the power spectral density of the codes (or constraint) from the examples above, we can compute the total power transferred to the tag, denoted by P transfer , as a function of the inter-coil separation. In more detail,\nwhere the dependency of the power spectral density on T has been made explicit. Here, T opt is the optimal value for T , i.e., the value that maximizes the power transferred. In general, the value of T opt will depend on the code (or constraint) and give different transmission rates for different codes (or constraints). Since M is a function of the inter-coil separation, we can plot P transfer as a function of this parameter. Note that since different values of M will correspond to a different scaling of the function H(f ), T opt will not depend on the inter-coil separation.\nIn Fig. 5, we have plotted the continuous part of the power spectral density S V (f ) as a function of the frequency f for the different codes from Examples 1 through 4. Also, for comparison purposes, we have plotted the power spectrum of the MFM/Miller code taken from [6]. For all curves, we have used the same value of T = 1, which keeps R/T the same for all curves, since all codes have the same rate of 1/2.\nIn Fig. 6, we have plotted the total power transferred to the tag (according to the discussion in Section IV) for the different codes from Examples 1 through 4 as a function of the inter-coil separation. In particular, r l = 10 4 , c l = 2.76 · 10 −10 , and L 2 = 5 · 10 −7 . With these parameters, T opt = 1.7 · 10 −8 , 3.3 · 10 −8 , 1.9 · 10 −8 , and 1.5 · 10 −8 , for the codes from Examples 1 through 4, respectively. The mutual inductance as a function of the inter-coil separation is taken from Fig. 6 in [1]. Note that the Manchester code has the best power transfer, but the lowest transmission rate and does not provide any error-correction on the discretized Gaussian shift channel. In general, from the ﬁgure, we observe a trade-off between transmission rate and power transfer. For instance, among the three RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})-constrained codes, the 12-state code has the highest transmission rate, but inferior power transfer compared to the three-state code.\nFor comparison, in Fig. 6, we have also plotted the total power transferred to the tag for the RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})- constraint of Example 5 (with α = 0.64) as a function of the inter-coil separation. The choice of α = 0.64 is to have a fair comparison (the three-state code of Example 1 gives α = 0.64 for long random code sequences). The corresponding value for T opt is 1.5 · 10 −8 , which is the same as for the 12- state code (with one digit precision), but the constraint gives a higher power transfer, which means that codes achieving a better trade-off between transmission rate and power transfer could potentially be designed."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"G.
