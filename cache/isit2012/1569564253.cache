An OOC is a family of (0, 1)-sequences with a constant weight, in which 1 means signal \u2018on\u2019 and 0 signal \u2018off\u2019 [1]-[4]. The use of OOCs with good correlation proper- ties allows reliable and efﬁcient data transmission in optical CDMA (OCDMA) networks. The mathematical deﬁnition of an OOC is given in the following.\nDeﬁnition 1. Let X = {X i | 0 ≤ i ≤ L−1} be a set of (0, 1)- sequences X i = {X i (t)} N −1 t =0 such that |{t | X i (t) = 1, 0 ≤ t ≤ N − 1}| = w for any 0 ≤ i ≤ L − 1, where w ≥ 2. We call w the weight of X i , and L the size of X , respectively. The correlation Λ i,j (τ ) between X i and X j is deﬁned as\nwhere all the operations among the position indices are computed modulo N . If X has\nfor some positive integers λ a and λ c , we call X an (N, w, λ a , λ c )-OOC. The maximum correlation λ of X is\nIn general, it is desireable that an OOC have large size and small maximum correlation for a given length and a given weight, if it is applied to OCDMA systems. However, there is a tradeoff among the parameters of an OOC.\nTheorem 2 ([5], Johnson bound).

Moreover, if X satisﬁes\nwhere L ∗ is the right-hand side of (1), it is referred to as an asymptotically optimal OOC. In [3], Chung, Salehi, and Wei presented a guideline for design of OOCs, and gave some constructions of optimal OOCs. Since then, several constructions for (asymptotically) optimal OOCs with small λ have been reported in the literature (see [6]-[15]). Moreover, Omrani and Kumar proposed two-dimensional OOCs which spread both time and wavelength domain [17]. For a survey of two-dimensional OOCs, we refer to [18].\nIn this paper, we present two new constructions for asymp- totically optimal OOCs with λ = 1. We ﬁrst construct a\n(p − 1)p 2 , p − 1, 1, 1 -OOC with size p + 1 for an odd prime p by using the structure of Z p 2 , the ring of integers modulo p 2 . We then present an (M p 1 p 2 , M, 1, 1)-OOC with size (p 1 p 2 − 1)/M from a product of two ﬁnite ﬁelds, where p i is an odd prime and M is a positive integer such that M | p i − 1 for i = 1, 2. They have new parameters not covered in the literature, as shown in Table I.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Section II, we present a (p − 1)p 2 , p − 1, 1, 1 -OOC from Z p 2 . We con- struct a (M p 1 p 2 , M, 1, 1)-OOC with size (p 1 p 2 − 1)/M from a product of two ﬁnite ﬁelds in Section III. Finally, we give some concluding remarks in Section IV.\nThroughout the paper, we denote by x y the least nonneg- ative residue of x modulo y for an integer x and a positive integer y. We also denote by Z n the ring of integers modulo n for a positive integer n. The fuction I[x] is deﬁned as I[x] = 1 if x is true, and 0 otherwise.\nFor an odd prime p and a positive integer n, there exists an element α of Z p n such that the multiplicative group Z ∗ p n = Z p n \\p Z p n is generated by α, that is,\nThroughout the section, we assume that α is not only a primitive root modulo p, but also a primitive root modulo p 2 . Note that α i = 1 mod p for any 1 ≤ i ≤ p − 2, and α j = 1 mod p 2 for any 1 ≤ j ≤ (p − 1)p − 1. Using the primitivity of α modulo p and p 2 , it is possible to derive the following four lemmas which will be very useful in proving the optimality of the OOCs obtained by Construction A. Their proofs are included in the full version of this paper [20].\nLemma 3. Let τ 0 be an integer with 1 ≤ τ 0 ≤ p − 2. Then p α t 0 (α τ 0 − 1) = p α t 0 (α τ 0 − 1) mod p 2\nLemma 4.

The set X A in Construction A is a (p − 1)p 2 , p − 1, 1, 1 -OOC with size p + 1. Furthermore, it\nProof . It is obvious that the size of X A is p+1 by deﬁnition. Let τ 0 = τ p −1 and τ 1 = τ p 2 . For k, l ∈ {0, 1}, 0 ≤ i ≤ p k − 1 and 0 ≤ j ≤ p l − 1, the correlation Λ k,l i,j (τ ) between X (k) i and X (l) j is given by\nwhere the last equality follows from the fact that there exists exactly one value of t 1 with 0 ≤ t 1 ≤ p 2 − 1 satisfying t 1 = p 1−k α i (p−1)+t 0 for a ﬁxed t 0 . Now, we divide the problem into four cases according to k and l.\nCase i) k = l = 0: In this case, the only possible choice for i and j is that i = j = 0.

By summarizing the results of Cases i), ii), iii), and iv), we\ncan conclude that X A is a ((p − 1)p 2 , p − 1, 1, 1)-OOC with size p + 1. It is also easily checked that\nTherefore, X is asymptotically optimal with respect to the Johnson bound.\nLet F q be the ﬁnite ﬁeld of q elements and F ∗ q = F q \\ {0}, where q is a prime power.

Hence,\nTherefore, X B is a (M p 1 p 2 , M, 1, 1)-OOC by the results of Cases i) and ii). It is asymptotically optimal with respect to the Johnson bound since\nWe presented two asymptotically optimal OOCs with re- spect to the Johnson bound. One is based on the ring of integers modulo p 2 , and the other is constructed from the product of two ﬁnite ﬁelds.
