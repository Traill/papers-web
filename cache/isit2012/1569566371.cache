This was achieved by constructing a scheme that, in the presence of two transmit antennas, of two single- antenna receivers, and of CSIT that is delayed by one coherence time, manages to provide each user with 2/3 DoF, improving upon the 1/2 DoF corresponding to no CSIT. This same scheme though, as well as all subsequent schemes pertinent schemes, achieve DoF gains by suppressing the inherent diversity of the broadcast parallel channel. The current work proposes a novel broadcast scheme which, over the above described setting of the delayed CSIT broadcast channel, employs a form of interference alignment to achieve both full DoF as well as full diversity."},"body":{"text":"Many multiuser wireless communications settings are known to beneﬁt greatly from the use of CSIT feedback. It is the case though that such feedback is often hard to obtain sufﬁciently fast, and as a result, efforts have been made to ﬁnd ways to utilize delayed CSIT. One such case involves communication over the broadcast channel (BC), where recent advances by Maddah-Ali and Tse [1] have shown that stale CSIT can still allow for improvements in the channel\u2019s degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region. This same work in [1] developed a novel scheme that, in the speciﬁc setting of the multiple-input single-output (MISO) BC with 2 transmit antennas and 2 users each with a single receive antenna, can offer 2/3 DoF to each user, even when the CSIT is delayed by a coherence period.\nWhile achieving the optimal DoF, this novel scheme, as well as subsequent pertinent techniques ( [2]\u2013[7]), neglect diversity considerations, thus resulting in substantial suboptimality with respect to diversity. This suboptimality naturally contributes to substantial performance degradation, and thus brings to the fore the need for novel designs that can combine the signal manipulations that allow for full diversity, with the signal manipulations that utilize stale CSIT to give full DoF. We here propose a novel design which employs interference alignment [8] techniques to provide, in the aforementioned two-user MISO BC with stale CSIT, full DoF and full diversity.\nThroughout this paper, (\u2022) −1 , (\u2022) , (\u2022) \u2020 , tr(\u2022), det(\u2022) and rank(\u2022) denote the inverse, transpose, conjugate transpose,\ntrace, determinant and rank of matrix respectively, and || \u2022 || denotes the Euclidean norm. | \u2022 | denotes either the magnitude of a scalar or the cardinality of a set. Logarithms are of base 2. (\u2022) + denotes max(0, \u2022). diag(\u2022) denotes a diagonal matrix. We use . = to denote exponential equality, i.e., f (ρ) . = ρ d denotes lim\n= d and . ≤, . ≥, ˙ <, ˙ > are similarly deﬁned.\nAfter describing the system model and brieﬂy recalling the original MAT scheme, Section II describes the new DoF- optimal design, and Section III shows that the scheme achieves full diversity. As a side result, the interested reader can ﬁnd in Appendix VI an upper bound on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the MAT scheme.\nAs stated, we focus on the frequency-ﬂat MISO BC with two transmit antennas and two users with a single receive antenna. We consider a coherence period of T channel uses, during which the channel remains the same. Speciﬁcally we consider communication over L coherence periods, or equivalently L phases, where each phase coincides with a coherence period. During phase l (l = 1, · · · , L), the ﬁrst user\u2019s channel is denoted as h l = [h l,1 h l,2 ] ∈ C 2 , and the second user\u2019s as g l = [g l,1 g l,2 ] ∈ C 2 . For x l,t denoting the transmitted signals during timeslot t of phase l, then the corresponding received signals at the ﬁrst and second user respectively, take the form\n(t = 1, 2, · · · , T ), where z (1) l,t , z (2) l,t denotes the AWGN noise. The fading coefﬁcients are assumed to be i.i.d. circularly symmetric complex Gaussian CN (0, 1) distributed, and are assumed to remain ﬁxed during a phase and change indepen- dently from phase to phase. We let ρ denote the signal-to-noise ration (SNR), and we consider a short-term power constraint where E||x (t)|| 2 ≤ ρ. We also consider a communication rate of R bits per channel use, which is here taken to be the same for both users. We recall that the corresponding DoF takes\nthe form r = lim ρ→∞ R i log ρ , where r is also referred to as the multiplexing gain. Finally, for P e denoting the probability that at least one user has decoded erroneously, we recall the notion of diversity to be d = − lim ρ→∞ log P e log ρ (cf. [9]).\nRegarding knowledge of the channel state, we assume perfect channel state information at the receivers (perfect CSIR), but we only allow the transmitter perfect knowledge of CSIT with a delay of a single phase (single coherence time), and provide no knowledge of current CSIT.\nWe consider the minimum delay case where communica- tion, just as in [1], takes place over L = 3 phases, and we note that naturally the achieved optimal DoF performance cannot further beneﬁt from using L > 3 phases. The proposed design is presented here for simplicity only for the minimum phase-delay case (L = 3), for which it achieves the optimal diversity of 6 (3 coherence intervals, 2 transmit antennas). We note though that this design can be readily extended to the case where L is a multiple of 3, to again achieve the optimal diversity order of 2L. We will henceforth consider that L = 3.\nThe MAT scheme [1] applies irrespective of the coherence duration T , and it considers communication over L = 3 phases. Without consideration for the time index, in describing the scheme, we denote by {a 1 , a 2 } the two symbols intended for the ﬁrst user, and by {b 1 , b 2 } the symbols for the second user. During the ﬁrst, second and third phase, the transmitter sequentially sends x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ∈ C 2 where\n(3) Consequently the resulting input-output relationship seen by the ﬁrst user, takes the form\n \n \n \n \nNoting that ˜ H is almost surely of full rank, allows us to conclude that user 1 can achieve 2/3 DoF. Due to symmetry, the same holds for the second user.\nRegarding the diversity of the MAT scheme, we have the following.\nProposition 1: The MAT scheme gives diversity that is upper bounded by 3.\nWe brieﬂy note that the maximum achievable diversity that we can hope for is 6, simply because the transmitter has 2 antennas and because communication takes place over L = 3 statistically independent channel realizations (L = 3 phases).\nThe scheme applies to the case where the coherence period T is no less than 8. Without loss of generality, we will assume that T = 8, and that the entire coding duration is LT = 24 channel uses, spanning three different phases of 8 channel uses each. For l = 1, · · · , L, t = 1, · · · , T 2 = 4, we denote by x l,2t−1 the vectors transmitted during odd timeslots of phase l (i.e., during timeslots 1, 3, 5, 7 of phase l), and we denote by x l,2t (l = 1, · · · , L, t = 1, · · · , 4) the vectors transmitted during even timeslots of phase l.\nWe assign 16 information symbols {a 1,t , a 2,t , a 3,t , a 4,t } 4 t=1 to the ﬁrst user, and 16 symbols {b 1,t , b 2,t , b 3,t , b 4,t } 4 t=1 to the second user. Consequently for any given t = 1, 2, 3, 4, the transmitted signal vectors are designed as follows\nfor some positive constants {φ 1 , φ 2 , φ 3 , φ 4 } that are speciﬁ- cally designed later on.\nDue to symmetry, we can focus only on the ﬁrst user. The received signals, accumulated at the ﬁrst receiver, can be rearranged to take the form\n      \n      \n      \n      \nNote that H AA ∈ C 6×4 , H AB ∈ C 6×4 , and that the rank of [H AA H AB ] ∈ C 6×8 can generally not support decoding of [a t b t ] ∈ C 8 . This problem is bypassed by the structure of the designed scheme which allows for aligning some of the interference at the ﬁrst receiver (cf. Fig. 1), such that\n      \n      \nAt this point we randomly pick φ 1 , φ 2 , φ 3 , φ 4 from the set of all possible numbers that guarantee\nIt is then easy to show that this random choice of φ 1 , φ 2 , φ 3 , φ 4 , while satisfying the power constraints, also guarantees that the rank of ¯ H A is full with probability 1. Simple zero-forcing (ZF) decoding guarantees the 2/3 DoF for both users.\nWe again focus, without loss of generality, on the ﬁrst user, and consider joint ML decoding for the MAC channel corresponding to (13). We remind the reader that we are interested only in establishing the diversity of the scheme, i.e., we are interested in the case of r = 0 (R is ﬁxed). Directly from [10] we know that the probability of error in this lightly loaded regime (cf. [10]) is dominated by the outage event\nand as a result, the corresponding probability of error takes the form\nwhere for the above we considered optimal Gaussian distribu- tions for a t and b t .\nand after considering that H AA has a block-diagonal structure, we see that (17) implies that\n= 1 + ρ|h 1,1 | 2 + ρ|h 2,j | 2 |γ 3 | 2 |g 1,1 | 2 + ρ|h 3,j | 2 |γ 4 | 2 |g 1,1 | 2 +ρ|h 1,2 | 2 + ρ|h 2,j | 2 |γ 3 | 2 |g 1,2 | 2 + ρ|h 3,j | 2 |γ 4 | 2 |g 1,2 | 2\nwhere in the above, [E] J,S denotes the submatrix of matrix E that includes the rows of E labeled by the elements of set J , and the columns labeled by the elements of set S. Continuing we get that\nwhich directly shows that the diversity of the scheme is 6 (again for r = 0). At this point we also note that the above design can be readily extended to the case where L is a multiple of 3. The proof for this is simple and it is omitted. The result is summarized in the following.\nProposition 2: In the setting of the described two-user MISO BC with delayed CSIT, the proposed interference alignment based precoding scheme achieves full DoF and full diversity.\nIn the setting of the two-user MISO broadcast channel with delayed CSIT, we designed the ﬁrst scheme to achieve full DoF as well as full diversity. The scheme borrows from the techniques of interference alignment, which allow for combining the signal manipulations that increase the DoF with the signal manipulations that allow for full diversity. Future work can extend the result by analyzing the entire DMT behavior of the scheme, as well as extend the result to other BC settings.\nThe research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Community\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007- 2013) / ERC grant agreement no. 257616 (CONECT), from the FP7 CELTIC SPECTRA project, and from Agence Nationale de la Recherche project ANR-IMAGENET.\nIn deriving the diversity achieved by the MAT scheme, we again focus, without loss of generality, on the performance of the ﬁrst user.\nConsequently, in the presence of Gaussian input x 1 = [a 1 a 2 ] (cf. (3)), and noting that the noise term ˜ z (1) in (4) has zero mean and covariance\nP out (r) = P I(x 1 ; ˜ y (1) | ˜ H) < 3R \t (22) . = P log det(I + ρ ˜ H ˜ H \u2020 ) < 3R\nfor any positive . Consequently expanding the determinant and applying the Cauchy-Binet rule, gives\nρ −α l,j , for α l,j ≥ 0 , \t (25) gives that the diversity d(r) of the MAT scheme is upper bounded as\n         \n        \n         \n        \nAt this point it is easy to see that the diversity is upper bounded by 3 (see also Fig. 2)."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M.
