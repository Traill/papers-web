Transforming the weight distribution of a code to its dual domain, the Krawtchouk transform is intimately related to the MacWilliams identity and the Fourier transform.\nThe importance of the Krawtchouk transform is often witnessed by the linear programming bounds of codes, ﬁrst established by Delsarte in his famous work [4]. These bounds, derived from the Krawtchouk transform, dictates that the distance distribution a code must satisfy a set of linear inequalities. One well-known example of linear programming bounds is the MRRW bound [5], which is among the best asymptotic upper bounds for binary codes.\nDespite its importance, the Krawtchouk transform appears not as widely accessible as it deserves to be. This is perhaps in part due to the fact that the classical expositions of this subject are often somewhat obscure, difﬁcult for general audience.\nRecently, using the modern tool of normal factor graphs [6], Forney [7] has revisited the classical concept of MacWillams identities [3], [8], [9] and presented a transparent exposition.\nIn a spirit similar to that of [7], in this paper we present a graphical approach, also based on the framework of normal factor graphs, to the understanding of the Krawtchouk trans- form and its relationship to the MacWilliams identity and the Fourier transform. We believe that our approach will make this classical subject much more accessible to wider audience in coding theory community.\nMost identities in this paper can be better appreciated graphically. Due to length constraints, we are however unable to use excessive ﬁgures. Also for the same reason, we choose to omit most proofs. This leaves us some space to entertain some more interesting discussion, particularly the graphical proof of the main theorem (Theorem 1).\nWe ﬁrst present a concise review of related concepts and derive some preliminary results.\nFollowing [6] and [7], a normal graph factor graph (NFG) is denoted, by a graph (V, E), similar to a normal graph [10], where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges. In fact, (V, E) should be more rigorously understood as a hypergraph since an edge in E may only be incident on one of the vertices in V . In this case, the edge is called a \u201cdangling\u201d edge. We denote by E int the set of all regular or \u201cinternal\u201d edges and by E ext the set of all dangling or \u201cexternal\u201d edges. Associated with each edge e ∈ E, there is a variable x e taking values from some alphabet set A e . For notational simplicity, we may suppress the name of the variable and simply label the edge with the alphabet set A e . For any subset E ⊆ E, we use x E to denote the set of variables {x e : e ∈ E } and A E\nvertex v ∈ V , there is a function 1 f v (referred to as a local function ) on A E(v) , where E(v) is the set of all edges incident on v.\nGlobally, an NFG G gives rise to a function involving only the external variables x E ext . This function, denoted by Z G (x E ext ), is called the exterior function or partition function realized by G and is equal to the product of all the local functions {f v : v ∈ V } with all the internal variables x E int summed over. In other words,\nAn example of an NFG is given in Figure 1, realizing exterior function\nf 3 (x 2 , x 4 , x 5 , x 7 , x 8 )f 4 (x 6 , x 7 , x 9 )f 5 (x 8 , x 9 ) := f 1 (x 1 , x 3 , x 4 ), f 2 (x 3 , x 5 , x 6 ),\nf 3 (x 2 , x 4 , x 5 , x 7 , x 8 ), f 4 (x 6 , x 7 , x 9 ) := f 1 , f 2 , f 3 , f 4 ,\nwhere the latter two , . . . , notations are used as the short hands for the \u201csum-of-products\u201d form encoded by the NFG.\nWhen two NFGs realize the same exterior function, we say they are \u201cequal\u201d and may equate them by equality sign \u201c=\u201d. In addition, we may replace an arbitrary component of an NFG with another NFG that is equal to this component. This is more formally stated in the following lemma.\nLemma 1: Let H be a portion of an NFG G. If there is another NFG H that is equal to H, replacing H with H does not change Z G .\nIverson\u2019s Convention and Indicator Function \u2013 We will use the Iverson\u2019s convention [P ] to denote the evaluation of a boolean proposition P , namely, [P ] = 1 if P is true and [P ] = 0 otherwise. A {0, 1}-valued function will be called an indicator function, and will be denoted by the symbol δ with an appropriate subscript.\nIn this paper, the unit circle T on the complex plane is regarded as a multiplicative group. All other abelian groups will be written additively with the identity element denoted by \u201c0\u201d.\nFor any ﬁnite abelian group G, a character χ of G is the set of all homomorphisms mapping G to T . It is well known that the set of all characters of G form an abelian group G, called the character group of G. In fact, each group element x ∈ G also serves as a character of G: For any χ ∈ G, the image χ(x) of x under χ is also the image x(χ) of χ under\nx. This makes G = G. We will denote x(χ) and χ(x) both by bi-variate function ϕ(x, χ) deﬁned on G × G. Not as general as other results concerning character groups, the statement that G is isomorphic to G holds true when G is ﬁnite.\nThroughout the paper, index set I is the set {1, 2, . . . , n} for some positive integer n, and each element i ∈ I is associated with a ﬁnite abelian group G i . Then the character group G I of G I (deﬁned as the cartesian product\nFor any function f on G, its Fourier transform ˆ f , a function on G, is deﬁned via the following sum-of-products form:\nLet ϕ ∗ (x, χ) := 1 |G| ϕ(−x, χ). Then the function ˇ f on G deﬁned by\nEquation (2) implies that the Fourier transform of a multi- variate function over G I is separable.\nFor any code C ⊆ G I , function δ C deﬁned on G I denotes the indicator function of C, namely, δ C (x I ) := [x I ∈ C]. If C is a group code, then its dual code C ⊥ , a subgroup of G I , always exists. It is well known (see, e.g., [11]) that the indicator function of C and that of C ⊥ form a Fourier transform pair, up to scale.\nFor any two functions f and g over a ﬁnite abelian group G, their convolution f ∗ g is deﬁned as\nfor every x ∈ G. It can be veriﬁed that our deﬁnition of convolution is consistent with the classical deﬁnition of convolution (as that in system theory). A well-known duality theorem, often known as the \u201cconvolution theorem\u201d, says that f ∗ g = ˆ f ˆ g. Deﬁne ¯ f such that ¯ f (x) := f (−x) for every x ∈ G. Then as a corollary of the convolution theorem, the following lemma can be proved.\nWe note that analogous to this result, it is well known in signal/system theory that the Fourier transform of an autocor- relation function is the energy spectrum density, necessarily non-negative.\nThroughout the paper, whenever we speak of weight (or resp. distance), we refer to Hamming weight (or resp. Ham- ming distance).\nFrom this point on, we restrict all G i \u2019s to be identically some ﬁnite abelian group G. Let H be a function on G deﬁned by\nwhere we have no interest in the exact values of a and b but rather treat them as indeterminates.\nand we call W f [H], or simply denoted by W f , the weight enumerator of function f . Note that W f can be viewed as a polynomial in indeterminates a and b, and when f is the indicator function δ C of a code C, we write W f as a W C . Note that W C is indeed the classical deﬁnition of the weight enumerator of code C.\nAs in Forney [7], Equation (3) is readily realized by an NFG, and one may start from this point to derive the MacWilliams identity , relating the weight enumerator of f to that of the Fourier transform of f . For example, we present a version of the MacWilliams identity in terms W ˇ f :\nTo relate to subsequent development, we take a closer look at function H.\nFor any positive integer n, let N n = {0, 1, . . . , n}. Then N 1 = {0, 1}.\nLet M G be a N 1 -valued function on G, mapping the identity of G to 0 and all other elements to 1. We will write M G as M for simplicity, whenever the dependence of M on G could be inferred from the context. Let δ M G or simply δ M be the indicator function on G × N 1 deﬁned by δ M (x, m) = [m = M (x)].\nLet w be a function on N 1 deﬁned as w(m) = a 1−m b m , for every m ∈ N 1 , where again a and b are the indeterminates. The following lemma is easy to verify.\nThis allows the realization of W f by the following sum-of- products form, or its corresponding NFG:\nThe reader may wish to draw the NFG representing the above sum-of-products form.\nSuppose that G has γ + 1 elements. Deﬁne a bi-variate function κ n,γ on N n × N n as follows:\n(−1) j γ k−j m j\nn − m k − j\nIn the literature (see, e.g., [2]), the function is often viewed as a polynomial in m and is called the Krawtchouk polynomial. However, we prefer calling it the Krawtchouk function and will treat it as the transform kernel that deﬁnes the Krawtchouk transform: For every function f on N n , the γ−Krawtchouk transform (or simply, the Krawtchouk transform) of f is the function ˜ f on N n deﬁned by\nIt is straightforward to verify that all Krawtchouk trans- forms are invertible. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that κ n,γ (k, m) may be obtained as the coefﬁcients of polynomial (1 + γz) n−m (1 − z) m , namely,\nWe are particularly interested in κ 1,γ , which we call an elementary Krawtchouk function or elementary Krawtchouk transform (kernel) . It is easy to check: κ 1,γ (0, 0) = κ 1,γ (0, 1) = 1, κ 1,γ (1, 0) = γ, and κ 1,γ (1, 1) = −1. In the special case when γ = 1, the elementary Krawtchouk transform reduces to the Hadamard transform, or the Fourier transform over F 2 .\nThe following two lemmas appear fundamental in this de- velopment, one relating the elementary Krawtchouk transform with the Fourier transform and the other relating an arbitrary Krawtchouk transform with the elementary Krawtchouk trans- form. We will directly state the two lemmas graphically.\nLemma 5: For any k ∈ N n and m i ∈ N 1 , i = 1, 2, . . . , n, let\nFor any function f on G I , let function U f on N n be deﬁned by\nWe refer to U f as the weight distribution of f . The NFG representing the above sum-of-products form is shown in Figure 2.\nDeﬁne function W on N n by W (m) = a n−m b m , where a and b again are indeterminates. Then it follows for any m ∈ N n , and any m i ∈ N 1 , i = 1, . . . , n,\nGluing the NFG realizing U f with the NFG realizing W in the (6), we can identify the resulting graph with the NFG realizing W f . That is\nIn other words, the weight distribution is simply the coefﬁ- cients of the weight enumerator. In fact, if f is an indicator function, then U f (m) is precisely the number of words in the support of f that has Hamming weight m.\nThe main result relating the weight distribution of a function with that of its Fourier transform is the following theorem.\nTheorem 1: The weight distribution of f is the Krawtchouk transform of the weight distribution of the inverse Fourier transform ˇ f of f . In other words,\nNoting the difference between ϕ and ϕ ∗ and the fact M (x) = M (−x), the theorem immediately implies the fol- lowing.\nCorollary 1: The weight distributions of a Fourier trans- form pair f and ˆ f are related by\nReferring to the weight distribution of ˆ f as the dual weight distribution of f , we arrive at the conclusion that the dual weight distribution is the Krawtchouk transform of the primal weight distribution, up to a scaling factor. We now present a graphical proof to Theorem 1.\nProof: The LHS of (7) is realized by the NFG in Figure 2. Insert a dual pair of Fourier transformers as in Figure 3 (a). This does not change the exterior function. Group graph vertices of Figure 3 (a) as is shown. Replace the top group by ˇ f and replace each block representing ϕ, δ M by a block representing δ M , κ 1,γ . This results in the NFG in Figure 3 (b). By Lemma 4, the exterior function stays the same. Similarly invoking Lemma 5 on Figure 3 (b) gives rise to Figure 3 (c) without changing the exterior function. In Figure 3 (c), identifying the dashed box as U ˇ f completes the proof.\nTheorem 1 may be viewed as a different and more explicit form of the MacWilliams identity. In fact, it is possible to recover the MacWilliams identity from this theorem by ma- nipulating the graphs using the various identities we provided. Due to space limitation, we will not elaborate on this aspect.\nFor any function f on G I , let D f be the function U f ∗ ¯ f , i.e., the weight distribution of f ∗ ¯ f . We will refer to D f as the distance distribution of f . In the special case when f is the indicator function δ C of a code C ⊆ G I , we will write D C in place of D δ C for simplicity. We note here that C can be an arbitrary code, not necessarily a group code.\nLemma 7: Let d H (, ·, ) denote the Hamming distance. For any m ∈ N n , D C (m) = |{(c, c ) ∈ C × C : d H (c, c ) = m}|. Hence, the distance distribution of a group code C is, up to a scaling factor, the same as the weight distribution of C.\nDeﬁne the dual distance distribution ˜ D f of a function f as the Krawtchouk transform of the distance distribution of f . Then ˜ D f is the coefﬁcients of the weight enumerator W f ∗ ¯ f .\nBy Lemma 2, f ∗ ¯ f is non-negative, so are the coefﬁcients of W f ∗ ¯ f . We thus have recovered the following fundamental theorem.\nIn case when f is a code indicator function, this theorem forms the basis of linear programming bounds.\nRemark: It may seem that the development of this theorem is based on a group-theoretic setup. This is in fact unnecessary. To see this, suppose that each variable x i takes on values in a ﬁnite alphabet A. It is always possible to pick a group G of size |A| and establish an arbitrary one-to-one correspondence between A and G. Since we only consider Hamming weight and Hamming distance, any such correspondence satisﬁes the property that for any x, x ∈ G, x − x = 0 if and only if d H (y, y ) = 0, where x ↔ y and x ↔ y under the one-to-one\ncorrespondence. In addition, such a correspondence naturally extends to the character group of G by the chain of one-to-one correspondences A ↔ G ∼ = G.\nThis paper exploits the recent framework of normal fac- tor graphs and presents a more transparent picture of the Krawtchouk transform and its relationship to the Fourier transform and the MacWilliam identity. This relationship may be summarized in the diagram of Figure 4. In the roadmap of Figure 4, Forney [7] recently has taken the paths along the two arcs to establish the MacWilliams identity. This paper complements Forney [7] by emphasizing the Krawtchouk transform in the picture. We believe that this approach allows for a cleaner understanding of the Krawtchouk transform. We also rederived the non-negativity result of dual distance distribution. The approach of this paper can readily extend to cases where symbol alphabets are not identical. This may lead to linear programming bounds for more general codes, potentially useful beyond conventional applications."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"I. Krasikov"},{"name":"S.
