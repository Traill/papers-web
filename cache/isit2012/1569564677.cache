Golay sequence, zero odd periodic autocorrela- tion zone, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).\nIn modern communications, sequences with good correla- tion properties are desired for receiver synchronization and detection purposes. In 1961, Golay proposed the idea of aperiodic complementary sequence pairs [5], of which the sum of out-of-phase aperiodic autocorrelation equals to zero. Later on, Davis and Jedwab formulated a method for constructing Golay complementary pairs by using quadratic generalized boolean functions [3]. Due to this correlation property, Golay sequences have been proposed to construct Hadamard matrix for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system [20], and to control the peak envelope power (PEP) in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system [22], [23], [9].\nQuasi-synchronous code-division multiple-access (QS- CDMA) system differs from conventional CDMA system [6] in that it allows a small time delay in the arrival signals of different users. In this case, sequences with zero correlations centered at the origin are desired to eliminate or reduce the multiple access and multipath interference at the receiver end during detection. Such sequences are called zero correlation zone (ZCZ) sequences respectively [14]. As a result, the construction of new LCZ or ZCZ sequences for QS-CDMA system has received researchers\u2019s much attention [4], [8], [10], [15], [21], [24].\nIn [7], Gong et al presented several classes of Golay sequences and QAM Golay sequences with a zero autocorrela- tion zone (ZACZ) of length approximately a half, a quarter or one eighth of their periods. Please refer to [2], [11], [12], [1], [13] more details on quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) Golay complementary sequences.\nExcept aperiodic correlation and (even) periodic correlation, odd periodic correlation is also important [17], [18], [19]. Our motivation is to examine the odd periodic correlation properties of Golay sequences and QAM Golay complemen- tary sequences when it is being utilized for signal detec- tion and synchronization purposes in applications such as CDMA and conventional linear time invariant (LTI) system. More speciﬁcally, if a single Golay sequence or QAM Golay complementary sequence contains attractive autocorrelation properties which can be exploited during detection and thus improves the performance of the system. In this paper, we will present several constructions of Golay sequences and QAM Golay sequences with a zero odd periodic autocorrelation zone (ZOACZ), which have the similar zone as those in [7] under different constraints.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we provide the necessary preliminary materials required in the later sections. In Sections III and IV, we show the large zero odd periodic autocorrelation zone of Golay sequences and QAM Golay complementary sequences. Finally, we conclude our paper and point out that a Golay sequence cannot have the same zero autocorrelation zone and zero odd autocorrelation zone at the same time in Section V.\nLet a = (a 0 , a 1 , · · · , a N−1 ) be a complex sequence of period N . The aperiodic autocorrelation function, (even) peri- odic autocorrelation function and odd periodic autocorrelation function of sequence a at shift τ , 0 ≤ τ ≤ N − 1, are respectively given by\nR a (τ ) = C a (τ ) + (C a (N − τ )) ∗ ˆ R a (τ ) = C a (τ ) − (C a (N − τ )) ∗\nwhere x ∗ denotes the conjugate of the complex number x. Note that odd periodic autocorrelation function is also some- times referred to as negaperiodic autocorrelation function.\nDeﬁnition 1: Let δ 1 and δ 2 be two integers with 0 < δ 1 < δ 2 < N and denote L = δ 2 − δ 1 + 1. If ˆ R a (τ ) = 0 for any δ 1 ≤ τ ≤ δ 2 , then the sequence a has a zero odd periodic autocorrelation zone (ZOACZ) of length L.\nLet H ≥ 2 be an arbitrary integer, Z H be the integer residue ring modulo H, and ξ = exp(2π\nth root of unity. A sequence a = (a 0 , a 1 , · · · , a N−1 ) over Z H can be regarded as a complex sequence (ξ a 0 , ξ a 1 , · · · , ξ a N−1 ). The sequences a and b are called a Golay complementary pair if C a (τ ) + C b (τ ) = 0 for any 1 ≤ τ ≤ N − 1. Any one of them is called a Golay sequence.\nIn the following, we introduce some notations. We always assume that π is a permutation from {1, · · · , m} to itself, and (i 1 , · · · , i m ) is the binary representation of the integer i = m k=1 i k 2 m−k , where m ≥ 4 is an integer.\nDeﬁnition 2: Deﬁne a sequence a = {a i } 2 m −1 i=0 over Z H , whose elements are given by\nWhen H = 2 h , h ≥ 1 an integer, Davis and Jedwab proved that {a i } and {a i + 2 h−1 i π(1) + c } form a Golay complementary pair for any c ∈ Z 2 h in Theorem 3 of [3]. Later on, Paterson generalized this result by replacing Z 2 h with Z H [16], where H ≥ 2 is an arbitrary even integer.\nFact 3: Let a = {a i } 2 m −1 i=0 be the sequence given in Deﬁnition 2. Then the sequences a i and a i + H 2 i π(1) + c form a Golay complementary pair for any c ∈ Z H .\n1. s i,e = d e,0 + d e,1 i π(m) , μ i = 2i π(1) for any element d e,0 , d e,1 ∈ Z 4 .\n2. s i,e = d e,0 + d e,1 i π(1) , μ i = 2i π(m) for any element d e,0 , d e,1 ∈ Z 4 .\nd e,2 = 0, μ i = 2i π(1) , or μ i = 2i π(m) for any element d e,0 , d e,1 , d e,2 ∈ Z 4 and 1 ≤ w ≤ m − 1.\nWe deﬁne a pair of 4 q -QAM sequences A = {A i } 2 m −1 i=0 and B = {B i } 2 m −1 i=0 as follows:\nFact 4: The sequences A and B form a 4 q -QAM Golay complementary pair [13]. Furthermore, for q = 2, A and B become a 16-QAM Golay complementary pair which is constructed by Chong, Venkataramani and Tarokh in [2]; For q = 3, A and B become a 64-QAM Golay complementary pair which is presented by Lee and Golomb in [11], and Chang, Li, and Hirata [1].\nIn the remaining of this paper, we adopt the following notations: For an integer τ , 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2 m − 1, two integers i and i , 0 ≤ i, i , j, j < 2 m , we set j = (i + τ ) mod 2 m and j = (i +τ ) mod 2 m , and let (i 1 , · · · , i m ), (i 1 , · · · , i m ), (j 1 , · · · , j m ) and (j 1 , · · · , j m ) be the binary representations of i, i , j, j , respectively.\nIn this section, we will study the zero odd periodic autocor- relation zone of Golay sequences. In the following, we always assume that H ≡ 0 (mod 4).\nBefore presenting the main results in this section, we list six sets of conditions on permutations π. They all have the same condition on an afﬁne function with c 1 ∈ {H/4, 3H/4}.\n(D) π(m) = 1, π(m − 1) = 3, and π(m − 2) = 2. (E) π(1) = 1, π(2) = 3, and π(m) = 2.\nTheorem 5: If the Golay sequence a, deﬁned by Deﬁnition 2, satisﬁes one of the condition listed in (A) or (B), then the sequence a has the following property:\nTheorem 6: If the Golay sequence a, deﬁned by Deﬁnition 2, satisﬁes one of the condition listed in (C), (D), (E) or (F), then the sequence a has the following property:\nRemark 7: The above theorems show that some Golay sequences have a large odd periodic autocorrelation zone for c 1 ∈ {H/4, 3H/4}, while in [7], the authors showed that some Golay sequences have a large ZACZ for c 1 ∈ {0, H/2}. Examples shows that there is no any Golay sequence with the same large ZACZ and ZOACZ at the same time.\nIn the following, for any given integers τ and u, where 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2 m − 1, 0 ≤ i ≤ 2 m − 1 − τ and 0 ≤ u ≤ τ − 1, set v = u+2 m −τ, and let (u 1 , u 2 , · · · , u m ) and (v 1 , v 2 , · · · , v m ) be the binary representations of u and v, respectively.\nNow we partition {i : 0 ≤ i < 2 m − τ} into the following three disjoint subsets:\nJ 3 (τ ) = {0 ≤ i < 2 m − τ : i π(1) = j π(1) , i π(m) = j π(m) }. Hence, the aperiodic autocorrelation of a at shift τ is equal to C a (τ ) =\nProof. The proof is quite similar to that of Theorem 3 in [3]. For completeness, we give it here.\nz = min{1 ≤ k ≤ m : i π(k) = j π(k) }. \t (3) Obviously, z ≥ 2. For any i ∈ J 1 (τ ), let i and j be the two integers whose bits in the binary representation are deﬁned by\nIn other words, i and j are obtained from i and j by \u201cﬂipping\u201d the (z − 1)-th bit in (i π(1) , · · · , i π(m) ) and (j π(1) , · · · , j π(m) ). Note that the following facts hold when τ is given: 1) i → i is a one-to-one mapping; 2) j − i = j − i = τ ; 3) i π(1) = j π(1) . Therefore, i enumerates all the elements in J 1 (τ ) as i ranges over J 1 (τ ). Given i ∈ J 1 (τ ), by the deﬁnition of z in (3) we then have\nwhich indicates that ξ a i −a j /ξ a i −a j = −1, i.e., ξ a i −a j + ξ a i −a j = 0. Hence, we have\nProof. For the case i ∈ J 2 (τ ), setting i and j to be the two integers deﬁned by\na i − a j − a i + a j = i π(1) + j π(1) + i π(m) + j π(m) = H/2 for i ∈ J 2 (τ ), which results in i∈J 2 (τ) ξ a i −a j = 0.\nNote that for the cases J 1 (τ ) and J 2 (τ ), their proofs are independent of the choice of π and m i=1 c i x i + c 0 . Hence, by Lemmas 8 and 9, (2) can be reduced as\nReplacing τ by 2 m − τ, similarly, we have C a (2 m − τ) =\nNote that ˆ R a (τ ) = C a (τ ) − (C a (2 m − τ)) ∗ . We have ˆ R a (τ ) =\nLemma 10: With the same notation in Theorem 5 under condition (A), we have i π(2) = j π(2) for any i ∈ J 3 (τ ), 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2 m−2 ,\nProof. For any given i ∈ J 3 (τ ), i π(1) = j π(1) and j = i + τ imply that i π(1) = 0 and j π(1) = 1.\nFirst we will show that i π(2) = j π(2) for any i ∈ J 3 (τ ). Otherwise i π(2) = j π(2) , and then we have\nwhich indicates that i + τ < j since τ ≤ 2 m−2 . This is a contradiction with j = i + τ . Hence, one has i π(2) = j π(2) .\nFor any given i ∈ J 3 (τ ), let u and v be the two integers whose bits in the binary representation are deﬁned by\nIt is obvious to see that 0 ≤ u, v ≤ 2 n − 1. Note that the following facts hold: 1) i → j → u is a one-to-one mapping; 2) v − u = 2 m − (j − i) = 2 m − τ. Therefore, u enumerates all the elements in J 3 (2 m − τ) as i ranges over J 3 (τ ). We also have\n= [H/2(i π(2) + j π(2) ) + 2c π(1) ](i π(1) − j π(1) ) = 0,\nwhere the third equal sign is due to i π(2) = j π(2) and 2c π(1) = H/2. The equality above indicates ξ a i −a j /ξ a v −a u = 0, or\nProof of Theorem 5. Note that ˆ R a (2 m − τ) = −( ˆ R a (τ )) ∗ for 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2 m −1. To prove the case (A) is sufﬁcient to show that the left side of (6) is equal to zero for 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2 m−2 . This is given by Lemma 10. For the case (B), by deﬁning a mapping π (k) = π(m+1−k), k ∈ {1, · · · , m}, and replacing π by π , the conclusion follows from that in case (A).\nLemma 11: With the same notation in Theorem 6 under condition (C) or (E), we have i π(2) = j π(2) for any i ∈ J 3 (τ ), τ ∈ (0, 2 m−3 ] ∪ [3 · 2 m−3 , 2 m−1 ], and\nThe proof is similar to Lemma 10, and we omit it due to page limitation.\nProof of Theorem 6. Note that ˆ R a (2 m −τ) = −( ˆ R a (τ )) ∗ for 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2 m − 1. To prove the case (C) and (E) is sufﬁcient to show that the left side of (6) is equal to zero for 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2 m − 1 and 3 · 2 m−3 ≤ τ ≤ 2 m−1 . This is given by Lemma 11. For the cases (D) and (F), by deﬁning a mapping π (k) = π(m + 1 − k), k ∈ {1, · · · , m}, and replacing π by π , the conclusion follows from those results in the cases (C) and (E) respectively.\nIn this section, we will consider the ZOACZ of 4 q -QAM Golay complementary sequences deﬁned by (1), which are based on the quaternary Golay sequences. So throughout this section, we always assume that H = 4 and ξ is the primitive 4- th root of unity. For convenience to describe, denote s i,0 := 0 for 0 ≤ i < 2 m .\nTheorem 12: If the 4 q -QAM Golay complementary se- quence A, deﬁned by (1) with s i,e = d e,0 + d e,1 i π(m) if π(1) = 1, or s i,e = d e,0 + d e,1 i π(1) if π(m) = 1, where d e,0 , d e,1 ∈ Z 4 }, satisﬁes the condition (A) or (B), then the sequence A has the following property:\nTheorem 13: If the 4 q -QAM Golay complementary se- quence A, deﬁned by (1) with s i,e = d e,0 + d e,1 i π(m) if π(1) = 1, or s i,e = d e,0 + d e,1 i π(1) if π(m) = 1, where\nd e,0 , d e,1 ∈ Z 4 }, satisﬁes the condition (C), (D), (E) or (F), then the sequence A has the following property:\nIn Section III, the idea of the proof on the ZOACZ of Golay sequence a is to deﬁne one-to-one mappings i → i and j → j\nsuch that ξ a i −a j + ξ a i −a j = 0, or i → v and j → u such that ξ a i −a j − ξ a v −a u = 0.\nSketch proof of Theorem 12: Note that a i,0 is a quaternary Golay sequence a. Under those deﬁnitions of (i , j ), (u, v) and conditions of π and c 1 in Theorem 5 of Section III, one can check that\nSimilar to the discussion to the Golay sequences in Section III, we have\nfor any 0 ≤ e, f ≤ q − 1. Hence, for any given τ , 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2 m−2 , we have\nfor any 0 ≤ e, f ≤ q − 1. Hence, for any given τ , 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2 m−2 , ˆ R A (τ ) is equal to\n⎞ ⎠\n⎞ ⎠\nwhere the last equality is due to (9). Thus we ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 12.\nIn this paper, we have shown that some Golay sequences over Z H and 4 q -QAM Golay complementary sequences have a large zero odd periodic autocorrelation zone, where H ≡ 0 (mod 4) is a positive integer and q ≥ 2 is an arbitrary integer. The parameters of those constructions are the same to those in [7] except for the values of H and c 1 . Those classes of Golay sequences or 4 q -QAM sequences with large zero odd periodic autocorrelation zone are disjoint with those sequences with large zero autocorrelation zone. Those sequences with large zero autocorrelation zone centered around the origin can help reducing the multipath interference during the synchro- nization and detection, thus to improve the performance of the system. Single sequences with large autocorrelation zone can potentially be utilized to construct signal sets with desirable auto and cross correlation properties. This can help reduce the multi access interference. Note that a Golay sequence can not have the same large zero autocorrelation zone and zero odd autocorrelation zone. Otherwise, if R a (τ ) = ˆ R a (τ ) = 0 for some consecutive τ , then we have C a (τ ) = 0 for those consecutive τ . Since\nwhere N k = |{0 ≤ i < 2 m − τ : a i − a i+τ ≡ k (mod H)}|, then we have\nsince H is even, and then τ is even. This contradicts the fact that τ is consecutive or could be odd.\nFor the applications mentioned above, we should investigate the following questions:\n1) Look for sequences with zero autocorrelation zone which also process low odd periodic autocorrelation with the same zone.\n2) Look for sequences with zero odd autocorrelation zone which also process low periodic autocorrelation with the same zone.\n3) If the two above scenarios cannot be satisﬁed, then the alternative is to look for sequences with low autocorre- lation zone and low odd periodic autocorrelation with the same zone. This is equivalent to ﬁnding sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelation within a large zone."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"C. Y. Chang"},{"name":"Y. Li"},{"name":"J.
