An [𝑛, 𝑘] linear code 𝐶 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 is a 𝑘- dimensional subspace of 𝔽 𝑛 𝑝 𝑠 . A linear code 𝐶 over 𝔽 𝑛 𝑝 𝑠 is said to be constacyclic if it is an ideal of the quotient ring 𝑅 𝑛 = 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 [𝑥]/⟨𝑥 𝑛 − 𝑎⟩. When 𝑎 = 1 the code is called cyclic, and when 𝑎 = −1 the code is called negacyclic. The Euclidean dual code 𝐶 ⊥ of 𝐶 is deﬁned as 𝐶 ⊥ = {x ∈ 𝔽 𝑛 𝑞 : ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑥 𝑖 𝑦 𝑖 = 0 ∀ y ∈ 𝐶}. An interesting class of codes is the so-called self-dual codes. A code is called Euclidean self-dual if it satisﬁes 𝐶 = 𝐶 ⊥ . Note that the dual of a cyclic (respectively negacyclic) code is a cyclic (respectively negacyclic) code.\nCyclic codes are interesting from both theoretical and practi- cal perspectives. For example, they can easily be encoded, and decoding algorithms exist in many cases. When (𝑛, 𝑝) = 1, these codes are called simple root codes, otherwise they are called repeated root codes. Castagnoli et al. and van Lint [4], [12] studied repeated root cyclic codes. They proved that these codes have a concatenated structure and are not asymptoti- cally better than simple root codes. Negacyclic codes were introduced by Berlekamp [2]. Simple root self-dual negacyclic codes were studied by Blackford [3] and Guenda [8]. The algebraic structure of repeated root constacyclic codes of length 2𝑝 𝑟 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 as well as the self-duality of such codes has also been investigated by Dinh [6]. Conditions on the existence of cyclic self-dual codes of length 2 𝑟 𝑚 over 𝔽 2 𝑠 were studied independently by Kai and Zhu [10] and Jia et al. [11]. Jia et al. also determined the existence and the number of cyclic self-dual codes for 𝑞 = 2 𝑚 .\nIn this paper, we investigate repeated root cyclic and nega- cyclic codes of length 𝑝 𝑟 𝑚 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 with (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1. When 𝑝 is odd, we give necessary and sufﬁcient conditions on the\nexistence of negacyclic self-dual codes. When 𝑚 = 2𝑚 \u2032 , 𝑚 \u2032 odd, we determine explicitly the generator polynomials using ring isomorphisms. This provides simple conditions on the existence of negacyclic self-dual codes. We also answer an open problem concerning the number of self-dual cyclic codes given by Jia et al. [11].\nThroughout this section, 𝑝 is an odd prime number and 𝑛 = 𝑚𝑝 𝑟 , with 𝑚 an integer (odd or even) such that (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1. This section provides conditions on the existence of self-dual negacyclic codes of length 𝑛 = 𝑚𝑝 𝑟 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 . It is well known that negacyclic codes over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 are principal ideals generated by the factors of 𝑥 𝑚𝑝 𝑟 + 1. Since 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 has characteristic 𝑝, the polynomial 𝑥 𝑚𝑝 𝑟 + 1 can be factored as\nThe polynomial 𝑥 𝑚 + 1 is a monic square free polynomial, hence from [7, Proposition 2.7] it factors uniquely as a product of pairwise coprime monic irreducible polynomials 𝑓 1 (𝑥), . . . , 𝑓 𝑙 (𝑥). Thus from (1) we obtain the following factorization of 𝑥 𝑚𝑝 𝑟 + 1\nA negacyclic code of length 𝑛 = 𝑚𝑝 𝑟 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 is then generated by a polynomial of the form\nwhere 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥), 𝑖 ≤ 𝑙, are the polynomials given in (2) and 0 ≤ 𝑘 𝑖 ≤ 𝑝 𝑟 .\nFor a polynomial 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑎 0 + 𝑎 1 𝑥 . . . + 𝑎 𝑟 𝑥 𝑟 , with 𝑎 0 ∕= 0 and degree 𝑟 (hence 𝑎 𝑟 ∕= 0), the reciprocal of 𝑓 is the polynomial denoted by 𝑓 ∗ and deﬁned as\nIf a polynomial 𝑓 is equal to its reciprocal, then 𝑓 is called self-reciprocal. We can easily verify the following equalities\nIt is well known (see [6, Proposition 2.4] or [9, Theorem 4.4.9]), that the dual of the negacyclic code generated by 𝐴(𝑥) is the negacyclic code generated by 𝐵 ∗ (𝑥) where\nLemma 2.1: A negacyclic code 𝐶 of length 𝑛 generated by a polynomial 𝐴(𝑥) is self-dual if and only if\nDenote the factors 𝑓 𝑖 in the factorization of 𝑥 𝑚 + 1 which are self-reciprocal by 𝑔 1 , . . . 𝑔 𝑠 , and the remaining 𝑓 𝑗 grouped in pairs by ℎ 1 , ℎ ∗ 1 , . . . , ℎ 𝑡 , ℎ ∗ 𝑡 . Hence 𝑙 = 𝑠 + 2𝑡, and the factorization given in (2) becomes\nTheorem 2.2: There exists a self-dual negacyclic code of length 𝑚𝑝 𝑟 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 if and only if there is no 𝑔 𝑖 (self- reciprocal polynomial) in the factorization of 𝑥 𝑚𝑝 𝑟 + 1 given in (7). Furthermore, a self-dual negacyclic code 𝐶 is generated by a polynomial of the following form\nProof. Assume there exists a negacyclic self-dual code 𝐶 of length 𝑛 = 𝑚𝑝 𝑟 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 . Hence from (3) the code 𝐶 is generated by 𝐴(𝑥) =\n𝑖 𝑘 𝑖 , where the 𝑓 𝑖 are factors of 𝑥 𝑚 + 1. From (7), we can write\nwhere 0 ≤ 𝑎 𝑖 ≤ 𝑝 𝑠 for 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑠, and 0 ≤ 𝑏 𝑗 ≤ 𝑝 𝑠 and 0 ≤ 𝑐 𝑗 ≤ 𝑝 𝑠 for 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑡. Let 𝐵(𝑥) = 𝑥 𝑚𝑝𝑠 +1 𝐴(𝑥) , and substituting 𝐴(𝑥) above gives\nUsing (5) repeatedly in the factorization of 𝐻(𝑥), we obtain 𝐵 ∗ (𝑥) = 𝑔 𝑝 𝑟 −𝑎 1 1 (𝑥) . . . 𝑔 𝑝 𝑟 −𝑎 𝑠 𝑠 (𝑥)\nSince 𝐶 is self-dual, from Lemma 2.1 we have that 𝐴(𝑥) = 𝐵 ∗ (𝑥), and then by equating factors of 𝐴(𝑥) and 𝐵 ∗ (𝑥), the powers of these factors must satisfy 𝑎 𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑠 −𝑎 𝑖 for 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑠, and 𝑏 𝑗 = 𝑝 𝑠 − 𝑏 𝑗 for 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑡. Equivalently, 𝑝 𝑠 = 2𝑎 𝑖 for 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑠, and 𝑐 𝑗 = 𝑝 𝑠 − 𝑏 𝑗 for 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑡. Since 𝑝 is odd, the last equalities are possible if and only if there is no 𝑔 𝑖 in the factorization of 𝑥 𝑚𝑝 𝑠 + 1 and 𝑐 𝑗 = 𝑝 𝑠 − 𝑏 𝑗 , for 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑡, i.e, 𝑠 = 0 in (7) and 𝑐 𝑗 = 𝑝 𝑠 − 𝑏 𝑗 , for 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑡. Hence a negacyclic self-dual code is generated by\nLemma 2.3: Let 𝑝 𝑠 be an odd prime. Then the following holds\n(i) If 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 4, 𝑠 any integer or 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4 and 𝑠 even, then 𝑥 2 + 1 = 0 has a solution 𝛾 ∈ 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 .\n(ii) If 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4, 𝑠 odd, then 𝑥 2 + 1 is irreducible in 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 . Proof. Since 𝑝 ≡ 1 (mod 4), −1 is a quadratic residue in 𝔽 𝑝 ⊂ 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 [9, Lemma 6.2.4]. Thus there exists 𝛾 ∈ 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 such that 𝛾 2 = −1. If 𝑝 ≡ 3 (mod 4), then 𝑝 2 ≡ 1 (mod 4), so that −1 is a quadratic residue in 𝔽 𝑝 2 ⊂ 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 . The proof of (ii) is in [6, Proposition 3.1 (ii)]. \t □\nIn this section, we consider the structure of negacyclic codes over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 of length 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 . We begin with the following lemma. When (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1, 𝑚 an odd integer, Dinh and L´opez-Permouth [7, Proposition 5.1] proved that negacyclic codes of length 𝑚 are isomorphic to cyclic codes. Batoul et al. [1] proved that under some conditions, there also exists an isomorphism between constacyclic codes and cyclic codes of length 𝑚. In the following lemma, we prove that there is an isomorphism between cyclic codes and some constacyclic codes with conditions different from those in [1], [7].\nLemma 3.1: Let 𝑝 𝑠 be an odd prime power such that 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 4, 𝑠 any integer or 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4 and 𝑠 even. Then there is a ring isomorphism between the ring 𝔽 𝑝𝑠 [𝑥] 𝑥 𝑚 −1 and the\n{ 𝑓(𝛾𝑥) if 𝑚 ≡ 3 mod 4, 𝑓(−𝛾𝑥) if 𝑚 ≡ 1 mod 4.\n𝑥 𝑚 +𝛾 given by 𝜇(𝑓(𝑥)) =\n{ 𝑓(−𝛾𝑥) if 𝑚 ≡ 3 mod 4, 𝑓(𝛾𝑥) if 𝑚 ≡ 1 mod 4.\nProof. From the assumptions on 𝑝 and 𝑠 in Lemma 2.3, there exists a solution 𝛾 to 𝑥 2 + 1 = 0. We only prove the ring isomorphism between the ring 𝔽 𝑝𝑠 [𝑥] 𝑥 𝑚 −1 and the ring 𝔽 𝑝𝑠 [𝑥] 𝑥 𝑚 −𝛾 . The other isomorphism can easily be obtained in a similar manner. Since 𝛾 2 = −1, we have that 𝛾 𝑚 = 𝛾 if 𝑚 ≡ 1 mod 4, and 𝛾 𝑚 = −𝛾 if 𝑚 ≡ 3 mod 4. Assume that 𝑚 ≡ 3 mod 4, so that 𝜇𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑓(𝛾𝑥) for 𝑓(𝑥) ∈ 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 [𝑥]. It is obvious that 𝜇 is a ring homomorphism, hence we only need to prove that 𝜇 is a one-to-one map. For this, let 𝑓(𝑥) and 𝑔(𝑥) be polynomials in 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 [𝑥] such that\nThis is equivalent to the existence of ℎ(𝑥) ∈ 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 [𝑥] such that 𝑓(𝑥) − 𝑔(𝑥) = ℎ(𝑥)(𝑥 𝑚 − 1), and this equality is true if and only if 𝑓(𝛾𝑥) − 𝑔(𝛾𝑥) = ℎ(𝛾𝑥)((𝛾𝑥) 𝑚 − 1) is true. The assumption on 𝑚 gives that 𝛾 𝑚 = −𝛾. Then we have 𝑓(𝛾𝑥) − 𝑔(𝛾𝑥) = −𝛾ℎ(𝛾𝑥)(𝑥 𝑚 − 𝛾). This equality is equivalent to 𝑓(𝛾𝑥) − 𝑔(𝛾𝑥) ≡ 0 mod 𝑥 𝑛 − 𝛾. This means that for 𝑓 and 𝑔 in 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 [𝑥]/⟨𝑥 𝑚 − 1⟩, we have 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑔(𝑥) if and only if 𝜇(𝑓(𝑥)) = 𝜇(𝑔(𝑥)). Hence it follows that 𝜇 is an\nisomorphism. A similar argument holds with 𝑚 ≡ 1 mod 4 for 𝜇(𝑓(𝑥)) = 𝑓( −𝛾𝑥). \t □\nTheorem 3.2: Let 𝑝 𝑠 be an odd prime power such that 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 4, 𝑠 any integer or 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4 and 𝑠 even, and 𝑛 = 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 be an oddly even integer with (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1. Then a negacyclic code of length 𝑛 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 is a principal ideal of 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 [𝑥]/⟨𝑥 𝑛 + 1⟩ generated by a polynomial of the following form \t ∏\nwhere 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥), 𝑓 𝑗 (𝑥) are monic irreducible factors of 𝑥 𝑚 − 1, and 0 ≤ 𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑡 𝑗 ≤ 𝑝 𝑠 .\nProof. It sufﬁces to ﬁnd the factors of 𝑥 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 + 1. From Lemma 2.3, 𝑥 2 + 1 = 0 has a solution 𝛾 ∈ 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 , so 𝑥 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 + 1 can be decomposed as (𝑥 2𝑚 + 1) 𝑝 𝑟 = (𝑥 𝑚 + 𝛾) 𝑝 𝑟 (𝑥 𝑚 − 𝛾) 𝑝 𝑟 . The result then follows from the isomorphisms given in Lemma 3.1. \t □\nExample 3.3: In the case 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 4, 𝑠 any integer or 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4 and 𝑠 even, 𝑛 = 2𝑝 𝑟 , (i.e. 𝑚 = 1), there is a unique factor of 𝑥 − 1 which is 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥 − 1. Hence from Theorem 3.2, negacyclic codes of length 2𝑝 𝑟 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 are generated by\nThe purpose of this section is to provide conditions on the existence of self-dual codes. This is done considering only the length and characteristic. This gives conditions equivalent to those in Theorem 2.2 which are much simpler to verify. We ﬁrst present an example.\n(i) If 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 4, 𝑠 any integer or 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4 and 𝑠 even, then from Theorem 2.2 there exist self-dual codes of length 2𝑝 𝑠 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 if and only if none of the irreducible factors of 𝑥 2 + 1 are self-reciprocal. From Lemma 2.3, there is a solution 𝛾 of 𝑥 2 + 1 = 0 in 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 . Hence the irreducible factors of 𝑥 2 + 1 are 𝑥 − 𝛾 and 𝑥 + 𝛾. Neither of these polynomials can be self-reciprocal, as we have (𝑥 − 𝛾) ∗ = −𝛾(𝑥 + 𝛾) and (𝑥 + 𝛾) ∗ = 𝛾(𝑥 − 𝛾). Hence by Theorem 2.2 there exist negacyclic self-dual codes of the following form\n(ii) If 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4, 𝑠 odd, then from Lemma 2.3 𝑥 2 + 1 is irreducible in 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 . Furthermore, we have (𝑥 2 +1) ∗ = 𝑥 2 + 1. Hence by Theorem 2.2 there are no self-dual negacyclic codes in this case.\nThe results in Example 3.4 are also given in [6, Corollary 3.3]. We now require the following Lemma.\nLemma 3.5: Let 𝑚 be an odd integer and 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑖) the 𝑝 𝑠 cyclotomic class of 𝑖 modulo 𝑚. The polynomial 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥) is the\nminimal polynomial associated with 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑖), hence we have 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑖) = 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (−𝑖) if and only if 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥) = 𝑓 ∗ 𝑖 (𝑥).\nProof. Let 𝛼 be an 𝑚th primitive root of unity. The elements of 𝐶𝑙(𝑖) are such that 𝛼 𝑖 is a root of a monic irreducible polynomial 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥) = 𝑎 0 + 𝑎 1 𝑥 + . . . + 𝑥 𝑟 . Hence 𝑓 ∗ 𝑖 (𝑥) = 𝑥 deg 𝑓 𝑖 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥 −1 ) has 𝛼 −𝑖 as a root. Therefore 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑖) = 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (−𝑖) if and only if the polynomials 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥) and 𝑓 ∗ 𝑖 (𝑥) are monic with the same degree and the same roots, and hence are equal. \t □\nLemma 3.6: Let 𝑚 be an odd integer and 𝑝 a prime number. Then 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑚 (𝑝 𝑠 ) is even if and only if there exists a cyclotomic class 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑖) which satisﬁes 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑖) = 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (−𝑖).\nProof. Assume that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑚 (𝑝 𝑠 ) is even. We start with the case where 𝑚 = 𝑞 𝛼 is a prime power. We ﬁrst prove the following implication\nAssume that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 𝛼 (𝑝 𝑟 ) is even and 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝 𝑟 ) is odd. Then there exists odd 𝑖 > 0 such that 𝑝 𝑟𝑖 ≡ 1 mod 𝑞 ⇔ 𝑝 𝑟𝑖 = 1 + 𝑘𝑞. Hence 𝑝 𝑟𝑖𝑞 𝛼−1 = (1 + 𝑘𝑞) 𝑞 𝛼−1 ≡ 1 mod 𝑞 𝛼 , because (1 + 𝑘𝑞) 𝑞 𝛼−1 ≡ 1 + 𝑘𝑞 𝛼 mod 𝑞 (𝛼+1) (the proof of the last equality can be found in [5, Lemma 3.30]). Therefore we have that\nIf both 𝑖 and 𝑞 𝛼−1 are odd, then 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 𝛼 (𝑝 𝑟 ) is odd, which is absurd. Then it must be that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝 𝑟 ) is even, so there exists some integer 𝑗 such that 0 < 𝑗 < 𝑜 𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝 𝑟 ) and 𝑝 𝑗 ≡ −1 mod 𝑞. Therefore we have 𝑝 𝑟𝑗𝑞 𝛼−1 ≡ −1 mod 𝑞 𝛼 , which gives that 𝐶𝑙 𝑞 𝛼 (1) = 𝐶𝑙 𝑞 𝛼 (−1). Then for all 𝑖 in the cyclotomic classes we have 𝐶𝑙 𝑞 𝛼 (𝑖) = 𝐶𝑙 𝑞 𝛼 (−𝑖). Assume now that 𝑚 = 𝑝 1 𝑝 2 such that (𝑝 1 , 𝑝 2 ) = 1 and 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑚 (𝑝 𝑠 ) is even. Since 𝑚 = 𝑝 1 𝑝 2 , we have that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑚 (𝑝 𝑠 ) = lcm(𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 1 (𝑝 𝑠 ), 𝑜 𝑟𝑑 𝑝 2 (𝑝 𝑠 )) is even, and hence either 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 1 (𝑝 𝑠 ) or 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 2 (𝑝 𝑠 ) is even. Assume that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 1 (𝑝 𝑠 ) is even, then there exists 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 1 (𝑝 𝑠 ) such that (𝑝 𝑠 ) 𝑘 ≡ −1 mod 𝑝 1 . Therefore (𝑝 𝑠 ) 𝑘 (𝑚 − 𝑝 2 ) ≡ −(𝑚 − 𝑝 2 ) mod 𝑚, with 𝑘 ≤ 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 1 (𝑝 𝑠 ), and hence 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑚−𝑝 2 ) = 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (−(𝑚−𝑝 2 )). The same result is obtained for 𝑚 = 𝑝 𝛼 1 1 𝑝 𝛼 2 2 . Conversely, assume there exists a class for which 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑖) = 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (−𝑖). Then the elements of 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑖) are ±𝑖𝑞 𝑗 for some 𝑗, so 𝐶𝑙(𝑖) contains an even number of elements. On the other hand the size of each 𝑞 cyclotomic class is a divisor of 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑚 (𝑝 𝑠 ) [9, Theorem 4.1.4]. This gives that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑚 (𝑝 𝑠 ) is even. \t □\nTheorem 3.7: Let 𝑝 𝑠 be an odd prime power such that 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 4, 𝑠 any integer or 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4 and 𝑠 even, and 𝑛 = 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 be an oddly even integer with (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1. Then there exists a negacyclic self-dual code of length 2𝑚𝑝 𝑠 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 if and only if 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑚 (𝑝 𝑠 ) is odd.\nProof. \t Under the hypothesis on 𝑝, 𝑠 and 𝑚 we have from Theorem 3.2 that the polynomial 𝑥 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 + 1 = ∏ 𝑓 𝑖 (𝛾𝑥) 𝑝 𝑟 (𝑥) ∏ 𝑓 𝑝 𝑟 𝑗 (−𝛾𝑥), where 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥)\nand 𝑓 𝑗 (𝑥) are the monic irreducible factors of 𝑥 𝑚 − 1 in 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 . By Lemma 3.6, 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑚 (𝑝 𝑠 ) is odd if and only if there is no cyclotomic class such that 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑖) = 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (−𝑖). From Lemma 3.5, this is equivalent to saying that there are no irreducible factors of 𝑥 𝑚 − 1 such that 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥) = 𝑓 ∗ 𝑖 (𝑥). From the ring isomorphisms given in Lemma 3.1, we have that 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥) ∕= 𝑓 ∗ 𝑖 (𝑥) for all 𝑖 is true if and only if 𝑓 𝑖 (𝛾𝑥) ∕= 𝑓 ∗ 𝑖 (𝛾𝑥) and 𝑓 𝑗 (−𝛾𝑥) ∕= 𝑓 ∗ 𝑗 (−𝛾𝑥) are true. Then from Theorem 2.2 self-dual negacyclic codes exist. \t □\nExample 3.8: A self-dual negacyclic code of length 70 over 𝔽 5 does not exist. There is no self-dual negacyclic code of length 30 over 𝔽 9 , but there is a self-dual code over 𝔽 9 of length 126.\nLemma 3.9: Let 𝑝 and 𝑞 be distinct odd primes such that 𝑝 is not a quadratic residue modulo 𝑞. Then we have the following.\nProof. Assume that 𝑝 is not a quadratic residue modulo 𝑞. Then from [9, Lemma 6.2.2] 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝) is not a divisor of 𝑝−1\n2 , so from Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝) = 𝑞 − 1. Hence 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝) ≡ 0 (mod 4) since 𝑞 ≡ 1 (mod 4). If 𝑞 ≡ 3 (mod 4), then 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝) = 𝑞 − 1 ≡ 0 (mod 2). \t □\nLemma 3.10: Let 𝑛 be a positive integer and 𝑞 a prime power such that (𝑞, 𝑛) = 1. Then we have the following.\nProof. Let 𝑟 = 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑛 (𝑞) and 𝑟 \u2032 = 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑛 (𝑞 2 ). Then we have 𝑞 2𝑟 \u2032 ≡ 1 mod 𝑛, which implies that 𝑟∣2𝑟 \u2032 . Since 𝑟 is even, we have (𝑞 2 ) 𝑟 2 = 𝑞 𝑟 ≡ 1 mod 𝑛, and then 𝑟 \u2032 ∣ 𝑟 2 . Hence we obtain that 𝑟 \u2032 = 𝑟 2 . This proves part (i). For part (ii), assume again that 𝑟 = 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑛 (𝑞) is odd and 𝑟 \u2032 = 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑛 (𝑞 2 ). We then have that 𝑟∣2𝑟 \u2032 , and since 𝑟 is odd it must be that 𝑟∣𝑟 \u2032 . On the other hand, we have 𝑞 2𝑟 ≡ 𝑛, so that 𝑟 \u2032 ∣𝑟, and therefore 𝑟 = 𝑟 \u2032 . \t □\nCorollary 3.11: Let 𝑝 and 𝑞 be two distinct primes such that 𝑝 is not a quadratic residue modulo 𝑞. Then if 𝑞 ≡ 1 (mod 4) and 𝑝 ≡ 1 (mod 4), there is no self-dual negacyclic code of length 2𝑝𝑞 𝛼 over 𝔽 𝑝 or 𝔽 𝑝 2 .\nProof. From Lemma 3.9, if 𝑞 ≡ 1 (mod 4) and 𝑝 is not a quadratic residue modulo 𝑞, then 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝) ≡ 0 (mod 4). Hence from Lemma 3.10, 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝 2 ) is even. Then the proof of Lemma 3.6 implies that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 𝛼 (𝑝 2 ) is even. Hence from Theorem 3.7 there are no self-dual negacyclic codes of length 2𝑞 𝛼 𝑝 over 𝔽 𝑝 or 𝔽 𝑝 2 . \t □\nExample 3.12: For 𝑝 = 5, 𝑞 = 13 and 𝑞 = 17 satisfy the hypothesis of Corollary 3.11. Hence there are no self-dual negacyclic codes over 𝔽 5 and 𝔽 25 with lengths 130, 170 or 1690.\nIt is well known that the cyclic codes of length 𝑛 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 are principal ideals of 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 [𝑥]/(𝑥 𝑛 − 1), and these ideals are generated by the monic factors of 𝑥 𝑛 −1. Hence the importance of the decomposition of the polynomial 𝑥 𝑛 − 1 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 .\nLet 𝑛 = 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 , with 𝑚 an odd integer such that (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1. Then we have the decomposition 𝑥 𝑛 − 1 = (𝑥 2𝑚 − 1) 𝑝 𝑟 = (𝑥 𝑚 − 1) 𝑝 𝑠 (𝑥 𝑚 + 1) 𝑝 𝑟 . Since (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1, the polynomials 𝑥 𝑚 − 1 and 𝑥 𝑚 + 1 factor uniquely as the product of monic irreducible pairwise coprime polynomials given by 𝑥 𝑚 − 1 = ∏ 𝑘\n𝑗=1 𝑔 𝑗 . This is due to the fact that (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1, so the roots are simple [7, Proposition 2.7]. Let 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥) be a monic irreducible divisor of 𝑥 𝑚 − 1. Then there exists ℎ(𝑥) ∈ 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 [𝑥] such that 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥)ℎ(𝑥) = 𝑥 𝑚 −1, and hence 𝑓 𝑖 (−𝑥)ℎ(−𝑥) = (−𝑥) 𝑚 − 1 = −(𝑥 𝑚 + 1). Therefore 𝑓 𝑖 (−𝑥) is a monic irreducible divisor of 𝑥 𝑚 + 1. This gives that the factorization of 𝑥 𝑛 − 1 is\nHence a cyclic code of length 𝑛 = 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 is of the form\nwhere 0 ≤ 𝛼 𝑖 , 𝛽 𝑗 ≤ 𝑝 𝑟 , 1 ≤ 𝑖, 𝑗 ≤ 𝑘, and 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑖 ≤ 𝑘 is an irreducible factor of 𝑥 𝑚 − 1. This gives the following result.\nProposition 4.1: For 𝑝 an odd prime, the cyclic codes of length 𝑛 = 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 , 𝑚 an odd integer such that (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1, are generated by 〈∏\nwhere 0 ≤ 𝛼 𝑖 , 𝛽 𝑗 ≤ 𝑝 𝑟 , 1 ≤ 𝑖, 𝑗 ≤ 𝑘, and 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑖 ≤ 𝑘, is a monic irreducible factor of 𝑥 𝑚 − 1.\nIt has been proven [6], [10], [11] that cyclic self-dual codes exist if and only if the characteristic is 2. Since a self-dual cyclic code must have even length and characteristic 2, cyclic self-dual codes have repeated roots. In [11, Corollary 2], Jia et al. gave the number of self-dual cyclic codes in some cases. The remainder of this characterization was left as an open problem, namely the case when the length of the code contains a prime factor congruent to 1 mod 8. The following proposition is used in answering this problem.\nProposition 4.2: Let 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 8 be an odd prime num- ber, and 𝑚 be an odd number. Then we have the following implication\nProof. Since 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 8, from [9, Lemma 6.2.5] 2 is a quadratic residue modulo 𝑝. Hence 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 (2)∣ 𝑝−1 2 , i.e., 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 (2) = 2 𝑘 𝑒 for some 𝑘 > 0. Then from Lemma 3.10 (i) we have that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 (2 2 ) = 2 𝑘−1 𝑒. Using the same argument 𝑙 times, the result follows. \t □\nCorollary 4.3: Let 𝑛 = 2 𝑟 𝑝 𝛼 . Then there is a unique negacyclic self-dual code of length 𝑛 over 𝔽 2 𝑠 generated by 𝑔(𝑥) = (𝑥 𝑝 𝛼 + 1) 2 𝑟−1 in the following cases\n(iii) 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 8 and 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 (2) = 2 𝑘 𝑒, and 𝑠 = 2 𝑙 , 0 < 𝑙 < 𝑘.\nProof. Parts (i) and (ii) follow from [11, Proposition 2]. When 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 8 and 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 (2) = 2 𝑘 𝑒, for 𝑠 = 2 𝑙 with 0 < 𝑙 < 𝑘, from Proposition 4.2 we have that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 (2 𝑠 ) is an even integer. Hence from [11, Theorem 4] there is a unique self-dual code generated by 𝑔(𝑥) = (𝑥 𝑝 𝛼 +1) 2 𝑟−1 . □\n(i) For 𝑝 = 3 and 𝑠 = 5, the polynomial 𝑔(𝑥) = (𝑥 3 𝛼 +1) 2 𝑟−1 generates the unique self-dual cyclic code of length 2 𝑟 3 𝛼 over 𝔽 2 5 .\n(ii) For 𝑝 = 5 and 𝑠 = 6, the polynomial 𝑔(𝑥) = (𝑥 5 𝛼 +1) 2 𝑟−1 generates the unique self-dual cyclic code of length 2 𝑟 5 𝛼 over 𝔽 2 6 .\n(iii) For 𝑝 = 17, 𝑜𝑟𝑑 17 (2) = 2 3 , so 𝑙 = 2.
