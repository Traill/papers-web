In the case of delay-Doppler channel, a widely used method is the matched ﬁlter algorithm. It uses a pseudo-random waveform of length N, and, in case of non-trivial relative velocity between transmitter and receiver, its computational complexity is O(N 2 log(N )). In this paper we introduce a novel approach of designing waveforms that allow faster channel estimation. Using group representation techniques we construct waveforms, which enable us to introduce a new algorithm, called the ﬂag method, that signiﬁcantly improves the matched ﬁlter algorithm. The ﬂag method ﬁnds the channel parameters in O(m · N log(N )) operations, for channel of sparsity of order m. We discuss applications of the ﬂag method to GPS, and radar system as well."},"body":{"text":"A basic step in many wireless communication protocols [12] is channel estimation: learning the channel parameters a signal undergoes while traveling from a transmitter to a receiver. In this paper we develop an efﬁcient algorithm for delay-Doppler (also called time-frequency) channel estimation. Our algorithm provides a striking improvement over current methods in the presence of high relative velocity between a transmitter and a receiver. The latter scenario occurs in GPS, radar systems, and mobile communication of fast moving users, or very high frequency (GHz) communication. We start by describing the channel estimation problem that we are going to solve.\nDenote by H = C(Z N ) the vector space of complex valued functions on the set of integers Z N = {0, 1, ..., N − 1} equipped with addition and multiplication modulo N. We assume that N is an odd prime number. The vector space H is endowed with the inner product f 1 , f 2 = P\nWe consider the following mathematical model of time-frequency channel estimation [12]. There exists a collection of users, each one holds a waveform from H known to a base station (receiver). The users transmit their waveforms to the base station. Due to multipath effects, the waveforms undergo [11], [12] several time-frequency shifts as a result of reﬂections from various obstacles. We make the standard assumption of almost-orthogonality between waveforms of different users. Hence, if a user transmits S ∈ H, then the base station\nwhere m denotes the number of paths the transmitted signal traveled, α k ∈ C is the complex multipath amplitude along path k, with\n|α k | 2 ≤ 1, ω k ∈ Z N depends on the relative velocity along path k of the base station with respect to the transmitter, τ k ∈ Z N encodes the delay along path k, and W ∈ H denotes a random white noise of mean zero. The parameter m will be called the sparsity of the channel.\nProblem I.1 (Channel estimatiom): Design S ∈ H, and an ef- fective method of extracting the channel parameters (α k , τ k , ω k ), k = 1, ..., m, from S and R satisfying (I.1).\nSuppose the transmitter and the receiver waveforms S, R ∈ H are related by\nwhere W ∈ H denotes a random white noise of mean zero, and (τ 0 , ω 0 ) ∈ Z N × Z N . The pair (τ 0 , ω 0 ) is called the time-frequency shift , and the vector space V = Z N × Z N is called the time-frequency plane . We would like to solve the following:\nProblem I.2 (Time-frequency (TFS)): Design S ∈ H, and an effective method of extracting the time-frequency shift (τ 0 , ω 0 ) from S and R satisfying (I.2).\nA classical solution [4], [5], [6], [8], [12], [13], [14] to Problem I.2, is the matched ﬁlter algorithm. We deﬁne the following matched ﬁlter (MF) matrix of S and R:\nA direct veriﬁcation shows that for ζ 0 = e 2πi N (τ ω 0 −ωτ 0 ) , with probability one, we have\nwhere N SR ≈ 1 SN R is essentially (up to logarithmic factor) the inverse of the signal-to-noise ratio between the waveforms S and W. For simplicity, we assume that the N SR is of size O(1).\nIn order to extract the time-frequency shift (τ 0 , ω 0 ), it is \u201cstan- dard\u201d 2 (see [4], [5], [6], [8], [12], [13], [14]) to use pseudo-random signal S ∈ H of norm one. In this case M(S, S)[τ − τ 0 , ω − ω 0 ] = 1 for (τ , ω) = (τ 0 , ω 0 ), and of order O( 1 √ N ) if (τ , ω) = (τ 0 , ω 0 ). Hence,\nIdentity (I.3) suggests the following \u201centry-by-entry\u201d solution to TFS problem: Compute the matrix M(R, S), and choose (τ 0 , ω 0 ) for which |M(R, S)[τ 0 , ω 0 ]| ≈ 1. However, this solution of TFS problem is signiﬁcantly expensive in terms of arithmetic complexity, i.e., the number of multiplication and addition operations is O(N 3 ). One can do better using a \u201dline-by-line\u201d computation. This is due to the next observation.\nRemark I.3 (FFT): The restriction of the matrix M(R, S) to any line (not necessarily through the origin) in the time-frequency plane V,\nis a convolution that can be computed, using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), in O(N log(N )) operations.\nAs a consequence of Remark I.3, one can solve TFS problem in O(N 2 log(N )) operations. To the best of our knowledge, the \u201cline- by-line\u201d computation is also the fastest known method [10]. If N is large this may not sufﬁce. For example [1] in applications to GPS N ≥ 1000. This leads to the following:\nProblem I.4 (Fast matched ﬁlter (FMF)): Solve TFS problem in almost linear complexity.\nNote that computing one entry in M(R, S) already takes O(N ) operations.\nWe introduce the ﬂag method to propose a solution to FMF prob- lem. The idea is, ﬁrst, to ﬁnd a line on which the time-frequency shift is located, and, then, to search on the line to ﬁnd the time-frequency shift. We associate with the N + 1 lines L j , j = 1, ..., N + 1, through the origin in V, a system of \u201calmost orthogonal\u201d waveforms S L j ∈ H, that we call ﬂags. They satisfy the following \u201cﬂag property\u201d: For a receiver waveform R given by (I.2) with S = S L j , we have\n˛ ˛\n8 <\n1 + ε N , if (τ , ω) ∈ L j (τ 0 , ω 0 ); ε N , if (τ , ω) ∈ V L j ,\nwhere ε N = O( 1 √ N ), and L j is the shifted line L j + (τ 0 , ω 0 ). The \u201calmost orthogonality\u201d of waveforms means ˛ ˛ M(S L i , S L j )[τ , ω] ˛ ˛ = O( 1 √ N ), for every (τ , ω), i = j.\nFinally, for S L and R satisfying (I.4), we have the following search method to solve FMF problem:\n\u2022 Compute M(R, S L ) \t on L ⊥ . Find (τ , ω) such that |M(R, S L )[τ , ω]| ≈ 1, i.e., (τ , ω) on the shifted line L + (τ 0 , ω 0 ).\n\u2022 Compute M(R, S L ) on L + (τ 0 , ω 0 ) and ﬁnd (τ , ω) such that |M(R, S L )[τ , ω]| ≈ 2.\nThe complexity of the ﬂag algorithm is O(N log(N )), using the FFT.\nAnother solution to TFS problem, is the cross method. The idea is similar to the ﬂag method. We associate with the N +1 2 distinct pairs of lines L, M ⊂ V a system of almost-orthogonal waveforms S L , M , that we call crosses. The system satisﬁes\n8 <\nwhere ε N = O( 1 √ N ), R is the receiver waveform (I.2), with S = S L , M , and L = L + (τ 0 , ω 0 ), M = M + (τ 0 , ω 0 ).\nThe complexity of the cross method is O(N log(N )). First, we ﬁnd a line on which the time-frequency shift is located, and then searching for the spike on the line. However, applications of the cross method for channel estimation problem (I.1) is more involved, due to fake intersections, and will not be discussed in this paper.\nLooking back to Problem I.1, we see that the ﬂag method provides a fast solution, in O(m·N log(N )) operations, for channel estimation of channel with sparsity m. Indeed, identity (I.4), and almost orthogo- nality property, imply that α k ≈ M(R, S L )[τ k , ω k ]/2, k = 1, ..., m, where R is the waveform (I.1), with S = S L (see Fig. 5).\nThe ﬂag waveforms, that play the main role in the ﬂag method, are of a special type. Each of them is a sum of a pseudorandom signal and a structural signal. The ﬁrst has the MF matrix which is almost delta function at the origin, and the MF matrix of the second is supported on a line. The design of these waveforms is done using group representation theory. The pseudorandom signals are designed [5], [6], [14] using the Weil representation, and will be called Weil (peak) signals 3 . The structural signals are designed [7], [8] using the Heisenberg representation, and will be called Heisenberg (lines) signals. We call the collection of all ﬂag waveforms, the Heisenberg\u2013 Weil ﬂag system. In this section we brieﬂy recall constructions, and properties of these waveforms. A more comprehensive treatment, including proofs, will appear in [3].\nConsider the following collection of unitary operators, called Heisenberg operators, that act on the Hilbert space of digital signals by:\n[π(τ , ω)f ][n] = e 2πi N ω·n · f [n + τ ], \t (II.1) for every f ∈ H, n ∈ Z N .\nThe operators (II.1) do not commute in general, but rather obey the Heisenberg commutation relations π(τ , ω) ◦ π(τ , ω ) = e 2πi N (τ ω −ωτ ) · π(τ , ω ) ◦ π(τ , ω), where ◦ denotes composition of operators. The expression τ ω − ωτ vanishes if (τ , ω), (τ , ω ) are on the same line through the origin. Hence, for a given line L ⊂ V = Z N × Z N we have a commutative collection of unitary operators\nWe use the theorem from linear algebra about simultaneous diagonal- ization of commuting unitary operators, and obtain [7], [8] a natural orthonormal basis B L ⊂ H consisting of common eigenfunctions for all the operators (II.2). The system of all such bases B L , where L runs over all lines through the origin in V, will be called the Heisenberg (lines) system . We use the following result [7], [8]:\nTheorem II.1: The Heisenberg system satisﬁes the properties 1) Line. For every line L ⊂ V , and every f L ∈ B L , we have\n2) Almost-orthogonality. For every two lines L 1 = L 2 ⊂ V , and every f L 1 ∈ B L 1 , f L 2 ∈ B L 2 , we have\n\u201ea b c d\nNote that G is a group [2] with respect to the operation of matrix multiplication. It is called the special linear group of order two over Z N . Each element g ∈ G acts on the time-frequency plane V via the change of coordinates v → g · v. For g ∈ G, let ρ(g) be a linear\noperator on H which is a solution of the following system of N 2 linear equations:\nwhere π is deﬁned by (II.1). Denote by Sol(Σ g ) the space of all solutions to System (II.3). The following is a basic result [15]:\nTheorem II.2 (Stone\u2013von Neumann\u2013Schur-Weil): There exist a unique collection of solutions {ρ(g) ∈ Sol(Σ g ); g ∈ G}, which are unitary operators, and satisfy the homomorphism condition ρ(g · h) = ρ(g) ◦ ρ(h).\nDenote by U (H) the collection of all unitary operators on the Hilbert space of digital signals H. Theorem II.2 establishes the map ρ : G → U (H), which is called the Weil representation [15]. The group G is not commutative, but contains a special class of maximal commutative subgroups called tori 4 [5], [6]. Each torus T ⊂ G acts via the Weil operators\nThis is a commutative collection of diagonalizable operators, and it admits [5], [6] a natural orthonormal basis B T for H, consisting of common eigenfunctions. The system of all such bases B T , where T runs over all tori in G, will be called the Weil (peaks) system. We use the following result [5], [6]:\n˛ ˛\nWe deﬁne the Heisenberg\u2013Weil system of waveforms. This is the collection of signals in H, which are of the form S L = f L + ϕ T , where f L and ϕ T are Heisenberg and Weil waveforms, respectively. The main technical result of this paper is\nTheorem II.4: The Heisenberg\u2013Weil system satisﬁes the proper- ties\n1) Flag. For every line L ⊂ V , torus T ⊂ G, and every ﬂag S L = f L + ϕ T , with f L ∈ B L , ϕ T ∈ B T , we have\n8 <\n1 + ε N , if (τ , ω) ∈ L (0, 0); ε N , if (τ , ω) ∈ V L,\n2) Almost-orthogonality. For every two lines L 1 = L 2 ⊂ V , tori T 1 , T 2 ⊂ G, and every two ﬂags S L j = f L j + ϕ T\n, with f L j ∈ B L j , ϕ T j ∈ B T j , j = 1, 2, ϕ T 1 = ϕ T 2 , we have\nRemark II.5: As a consequence of Theorem II.4 we obtain fami- lies of N + 1 almost-orthogonal ﬂag waveforms which can be used for solving the TFS problem in O(N log(N )) operations, and channel estimation problem in O(m · N log(N )) for channel of sparsity m.\nWe deﬁne the Heisenberg cross system of waveforms. This is the collection of signals in H, which are of the form S L , M = f L + f M , where f L , f M , L = M, are Heisenberg waveforms deﬁned in Section II-A. The following is an immediate consequence of Theorem II.1:\nTheorem III.1: The Heisenberg cross system satisﬁes the proper- ties\n1) Cross. For every pair of distinct lines L, M ⊂ V , and every cross S L , M = f L + f M , with f L ∈ B L , f M ∈ B M , we have\n8 <\n2) Almost-orthogonality. For every four distinct lines L 1 , M 1 , L 2 , M 2 \t ⊂ \t V , and every two crosses S Lj , Mj = f L j + f M j , j = 1, 2, we have\n˛ ˛ ˛\nRemark III.2: As a consequence of Theorem III.1 we obtain families of N +1 2 almost-orthogonal cross waveforms which can be used for solving the TFS problem in O(N log(N )) operations.\nThe ﬂag method provides a signiﬁcant improvement over the cur- rent channel estimation algorithms in the presence of high velocities. The latter occurs in radar and GPS systems. We discuss applications to these ﬁelds.\nThe model of digital radar works as follows [8]. A radar transmits a waveform S ∈ H which bounces back from m targets. The waveform R ∈ H which is received as an echo has the form\n|α k | 2 ≤ 1, ω k ∈ Z N encodes the radial velocity of target k with respect to the radar, τ k ∈ Z N encodes the distance between target k and the radar, and W is a random white noise.\nThis is essentially a channel estimation problem, so the ﬂag method solves it in O(m · N log(N )) operations.\nThe model of GPS works as follows [9]. A client on the earth surface wants to know his/her geographical location. Satellites send to earth their location. For simplicity, the location of a satellite is a bit b ∈ {±1}. The satellite transmits to the earth its signal S ∈ H multiplied by its location b. The client receives the signal\nwhere ω k encodes the radial velocity of the satellite with respect to the client along the path k, τ k encode the distance between the satellite and the client 5 , α k \u2019s are complex multipath amplitudes, and W is a random white noise.\nProblem IV.2 (GPS problem): Find b given that S and R are known.\nIn practice, ﬁrst, S is sent and the channel estimation is done. In the second step, the bit b is communicated by sending b · S. Then the bit is extracted using the formula 6\nA client can compute his/her location by knowing the locations of at least three satellites and distances to them.\nThe main computational step is the channel estimation which is done by ﬂag method in O(m · N log (N )) operations.\nAcknowledgement.
