Let Z l = {0, 1, · · · , l − 1} be the ring of integers modulo l. An m-variable boolean function from Z m 2 to Z 2 is bent if it has maximal Hamming distance to the set of afﬁne boolean functions. Boolean bent functions have attracted much attention due to their important applications in coding theory, cryptography and sequence design. From the viewpoint of cyclic codes over a Galois ring [12], Schmidt introduced the generalized boolean bent functions from Z m 2 to Z p in 2009. When p = 4, Sol´e and Tokareva recently have shown the close connections between boolean bent and generalized boolean bent functions [13].\nLet F q be the ﬁnite ﬁeld with q = 2 m elements, where m is a positive integer. Several classes of bent or semi-bent functions in polynomial form have been constructed using the theory of quadratic forms over F q . Let f (x) be a quadratic function over the ﬁnite ﬁeld F q deﬁned by\nx 2 ni is the trace function from F 2 m to its subﬁeld F 2 n . How to choose the coefﬁcients a i such that f (x) is bent or semi-bent has been discussed in various papers. When m is even, a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for f (x) being bent was given in [8]. Yu and Gong followed the work to investigate the bentness of\nf (x) for some special values of m [14], and Hu et al. in [6] generalized it for general even m. Some similar results on semi-bent functions f (x) were given in [7] when m is odd.\nIn this paper, we ﬁrst investigate a class of generalized boolean bent functions of the form\nwhere T r m 1 ( ·) is the trace function from the Galois ring R to Z 4 , and L is the Teichm¨uller set of R. A necessary and sufﬁcient condition concerning the bentness of Q(x) is given based on the theory of Z 4 -valued quadratic forms [11]. By the choices of c i ∈ {0, 1}, new generalized boolean bent functions can be obtained. Speciﬁcally, a method to construct such generalized boolean bent functions is also presented by means of some simple polynomials over ﬁnite ﬁelds.\nFurther, by virtue of the links between generalized boolean bent and binary bent functions given by Sol´e and Tokareva in [13], new binary bent and semi-bent functions of the form\nare obtained in this paper, where p(x) is deﬁned as       \nSol´e and Tokareva\u2019s result together with our discussions show that the function f Q (x) is bent (resp. semi-bent) if Q(x) is generalized boolean bent with even (resp. odd) m.\nThe Galois ring R = GR(4, m) is the Galois extension of degree m over Z 4 . Let µ : Z 4 → Z 2 be the modulus 2 reduction. Naturally, the mapping µ induces a homomorphism from the Galois ring R to the ﬁnite ﬁeld F 2 m with 2 m elements. For simplicity, µ(x) is sometimes denoted by x.\nFor every element z ∈ R, it can be uniquely expressed in the form z = x + 2y, x, y ∈ L, where L is the Teichm¨uller set of R deﬁned by L = {z ∈ R : z 2 m = z }. Clearly, the Teichm¨uller set L is isomorphic to F 2 m , i.e., µ( L) = F 2 m .\nThe relation between the trace function over Z 4 and that over Z 2 is well known:\nIt should be noted that the addition operation in L is not closed. Specially, for any x, y ∈ L, there exists a unique z ∈ L such that z = x + y + 2\nwe deﬁne a new operation ⊕ on L by x ⊕ y = x + y + 2\nEssentially, ( L, ⊕, ·) is isomorphic to (F 2 m , +, ·). B. Bent Functions\nIn this paper, we mainly consider the following two kinds of bent functions.\n1) Boolean bent function: Let f : F 2 m → F 2 be a boolean function in m variables. The Walsh transform of f is deﬁned by\n2) Generalized boolean bent function: Let f : L → Z 4 be a generalized boolean function in m variables, and i =\nNote that generalized boolean bent functions exist for both even m and odd m, while boolean bent functions only exist for even m [10]. A boolean function f (x) in m variables is called semi-bent if f (λ) ∈ {0, ±2 ⌊(m+2)/2⌋ } for all λ ∈ F q [2], [3].\nSol´e and Tokareva recently studied the connections between binary bent and generalized boolean bent functions, and ob- tained the following results.\nLemma 1: ( [13]) Let g(x) be a generalized boolean func- tion over Z 4 and g(x) = a(x) + 2b(x) be its 2-adic expansion, where x ∈ L, a(·) and b(·) are boolean functions over F 2 m . Let ϕ g (y, z) = a(y)z +b(y) be a boolean function in variables (y, z) with y ∈ F 2 m and z ∈ Z 2 . Then,\n2) For even m, g(x), x ∈ L, is bent if and only if both b(x) and a(x) + b(x), x ∈ F 2 m , are bent;\n3) If g(x) is bent, then ϕ g (y, z) is either bent (m odd) or semi-bent (m even).\nA symmetric bilinear form on L is a mapping B : L×L → Z 2 with two properties\nSpeciﬁcally, B is called alternating if B(x, x) = 0 for all x ∈ L.\nThe rank of B is deﬁned as rank(B) = m − dim Z 2 (rad(B)), where\nA Z 4 -valued quadratic form [1] is a mapping F : L → Z 4 that satisﬁes\nwhere B : L × L → Z 2 is a symmetric bilinear form. In addition, F is called alternating if B is alternating. Similarly, the rank of F is deﬁned as rank(F ) = rank(B).\nIf F is alternating, it is well known that the Walsh distri- bution completely depends on its rank [5]. Schmidt developed the theory of Z 4 -valued quadratic form and established the similar result for f being nonalternating, see [11] for more details, from which one can easily get the following result.\nLemma 2: ( [11]) For a Z 4 -valued quadratic form F (x), F (x) is generalized boolean bent if and only if F (x) is of full rank.\nFor positive integer k, we discuss the generalized boolean functions Q(x) of the form (1) based on the Z 4 -valued quadratic forms in this section.\nFirstly, we need the following lemma. Lemma 3: ( [9]) Let G(x) =\nλ i x 2 i ∈ F 2 [x] and g(x) =\nλ i x i . Then G(x) = 0 has only one root in F 2 m if and only if gcd(g(x), x m − 1) = 1.\nNote that Q(x) deﬁned by (1) is a Z 4 -valued quadratic form, and by the deﬁnition one can derive\nRecall that L is isomorphic to F 2 m under the mapping µ, and 2T r m 1 (x) = 2tr m 1 (x), therefore we discuss the above equality over the ﬁnite ﬁeld F 2 m instead of L in order to be consistent with Lemma 3. Then together with (4), to determine the rank of Q(x), we have to consider the roots of\nSince x 2 −ki = x 2 m −ki = x 2 (m −i)k if x ∈ F 2 m , then (5) can be rewritten as\nAccording to Lemma 2, Q(x) is bent if and only if it has full rank, i.e., (6) has only one root in F 2 m . By Lemma 3, one has that (6) has only one root in F 2 m if and only if gcd(c(x k ), x m − 1) = 1, where\nTheorem 1: The function Q(x) deﬁned by (1) is general- ized boolean bent if and only if gcd(c(x k ), x m −1) = 1, where c(x) is deﬁned by (7).\nIn what follows, we give some speciﬁc values on c i , 1 ≤ i ≤ ⌊ m −1 2 ⌋, and discuss the bentness of Q(x) deﬁned by (1).\nQ(x) = T r m 1 (x + 2x 1+2 2k + 2x 1+2 3k ), x ∈ L, is bent if and only if gcd(m, 3k) = gcd(m, k).\nProof: By (7), c(x) = 1 + x 2 + x 3 + x m −3 + x m −2 , then gcd(c(x k ), x m − 1)\n= gcd(x 6k + x 5k + x 3k + x k + 1, x m − 1) = gcd(( x 3k −1 x k −1 ) 3 , x m − 1).\nThus, gcd(c(x k ), x m − 1) = 1 if and only if gcd(m, 3k) = gcd(m, k).\nCorollary 2: Let m, k and t be positive integers with even (resp. odd) m and t < m −2 4 (resp. m −1 2 ), then\nis bent if and only if gcd(m, (2t + 1)k) = gcd(m, k), and gcd(m, (2t + 3)k) = gcd(m, k).\nc(x) = 1 + x + x 3 + · · · + x 2t+1 + x m −(2t+1) + · · · + x m −1 , and deduce that\nCorollary 3: Let m, k and t be positive integers with even (resp. odd) m and t < m 4 (resp. m −1 2 ), then\nis bent if and only if gcd(m, (2t − 1)k) = gcd(m, k), and gcd(m, (2t + 3)k) = gcd(m, k).\nx 3k + · · · + x (2t −3)k ) + x (2t+4)k (1 + x 2k + · · · +x (2t −4)k ), x m − 1)\n= gcd((1 + x k + x 2k + · · · + x (2t+2)k ) + (1 + x 2k + · · · + x (2t −4)k )(x (2t+4)k + x k ), x m − 1)\nCorollary 4: Let m and k be positive integers with 1 ≤ t < m/2, then\nis bent if and only if gcd(m, (2t + 1)k) = gcd(m, k). Proof: In this case, one can have c(x) = 1 +\n(x i + x m −i ), and\nNote that for distinct concrete values on c i , 1 ≤ i ≤ ⌊ m −1 2 ⌋, different generalized boolean bent functions can be obtained if gcd(c(x k ), x m − 1) = 1, where c(x) is deﬁned by (7). In addition, new generalized boolean bent functions can also be obtained from the method as below.\nTheorem 2: Assume that h(x) ∈ Z 2 [x] with even degree s and s < 2m. If h(x) can be written as\nwhere r is a positive integer and n i , 1 ≤ i ≤ r, are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n 1 < · · · < n r < s/2, then, for any positive integer k, the generalized boolean function\nProof: This can be easily veriﬁed according to Theorem 1. From Theorem 2, new generalized boolean bent functions\nF 2 for positive integer j, and denotes h(x) in Theorem 2 by h n 1 , ··· ,n r ,s/2 (x), then one can derive\nCorollary 5: Let h(x) be the functions in (8), then we have 1) Q(x) = T r m 1 (x + 2x 1+2 2k + 2x 1+2 5k + 2x 1+2 6k ) is bent\n2) Q(x) = T r m 1 (x+2x 1+2 k +2x 1+2 4k +2x 1+2 5k ) is bent if and only if gcd(m, 3k) = gcd(m, k), and gcd(m, 7k) = gcd(m, k);\n3) Q(x) = T r m 1 (x + 2x 1+2 3k + 2x 1+2 5k + 2x 1+2 6k ) is bent if and only if gcd(m, 3k) = gcd(m, k), gcd(m, 5k) = gcd(m, k), and gcd(m, 7k) = gcd(m, k).\nProof: We only give the proof for case 1), and the other cases can be similarly proven. According to Theorem 2 and (8), Q(x) is bent if and only if gcd(h(x k ), x m − 1) = 1, where h(x) = h 2,5,6 (x) = e 2 (x) 3 = ( x 5 −1 x −1 ) 3 . Then gcd(h(x k ), x m − 1) = gcd(( x 5k −1 x k −1 ) 3 , x m − 1) = 1 if and only if gcd(m, 5k) = gcd(m, k).\nRemark 1: The function h(x) can be generated by taking different combinations of e(j, x) or by other functions. Thus, many new generalized boolean bent functions can be obtained in a very simple way based on this method.\nThe connections between boolean bent and generalized boolean bent functions have been revealed in [13]. By Lemma 1, ϕ Q is binary bent (resp. semi-bent) for even (resp. odd) m if Q(x) is generalized boolean bent. In this section, new binary bent and semi-bent functions can be obtained based on Lemma 1 and the generalized boolean bent functions constructed in Section III.\nFirst of all, we need the following representation of the trace function over a Galois ring.\nLemma 4: ( [4]) The trace function over GR(4, m) has 2- adic expansion as\nBy Lemma 4, the function Q(x) deﬁned by (1) can be expressed as Q(x) = a(x) + 2b(x), x ∈ L, where a(x) = tr m 1 (x), and b(x) = p(x) +\nNote that b(x) with x ∈ F 2 m is in fact the boolean function f Q (x) deﬁned by (2). For even m, by Lemma 1 one has that both b(x) and a(x) + b(x) are binary bent if Q(x) is generalized boolean bent. If m is odd and Q(x) is generalized boolean bent, again by Lemma 1, one can get\nwhich leads to ( |b(λ)|, |a + b(λ)|) = (0, 2 (m+1)/2 ) or (2 (m+1)/2 , 0) for all λ ∈ L due to the well known results\nabout the solution to the diophantine equation. This implies b(x) is semi-bent.\nThus, we can obtain the following result from Theorem 1. Theorem 3: Let m and k be positive integers with even\n(resp. odd) m and let p(x) be deﬁned by (3). Then the binary function f Q (x) deﬁned by (2) is bent (resp. semi-bent) if and only if gcd(c(x k ), x m − 1) = 1, where c(x) is deﬁned by (7).\nSpecially, if one takes Q(x) as the functions obtained in the Corollaries 1-4 in Section III, then the following bent and semi-bent functions can be obtained.\nCorollary 6: Let m be a positive even (resp. odd) integer. Then\n1) f Q (x) = p(x) + tr m 1 (x 1+2 2k ) + tr m 1 (x 1+2 3k ) is bent (resp. semi-bent) if and only if gcd(m, 3k) = gcd(m, k);\ntr m 1 (x 1+2 (2i+1)k ) is bent (resp. semi-bent) if and only if gcd(m, (2t+1)k) = gcd(m, k), and gcd(m, (2t + 3)k) = gcd(m, k);\ntr m 1 (x 1+2 2ik ) is bent (resp. semi-bent) if and only if gcd(m, (2t −1)k) = gcd(m, k), and gcd(m, (2t + 3)k) = gcd(m, k);\ntr m 1 (x 1+2 ik ) is bent (resp. semi- bent) if and only if gcd(m, (2t + 1)k) = gcd(m, k).\ntr(x 1+2 ik ) is bent in F 2 m for even m if and only if gcd(m, (2t + 1)k) = gcd(m, k). This has been obtained in [6], and we apply a different approach here. Thus, in the sense of Lemma 1, the generalized boolean bent function in Corollary 4 is not new for even m, but it is novel for odd m. Hence, the semi-bent functions obtained here also are new.\nCorollary 7: Let Q(x) be the functions in Corollary 5 with even (resp. odd) m, and p(x) be deﬁned by (3). Then\n1) f Q (x) = p(x) + tr m 1 (x 1+2 2k ) + tr m 1 (x 1+2 5k ) + tr m 1 (x 1+2 6k ) is bent (resp. semi-bent) if and only if gcd(m, 5k) = gcd(m, k);\n2) f Q (x) = p(x) + tr m 1 (x 1+2 k ) + tr m 1 (x 1+2 4k ) + tr m 1 (x 1+2 5k ) is bent (resp. semi-bent) if and only if gcd(m, 3k) = gcd(m, k), and gcd(m, 7k) = gcd(m, k);\n3) f Q (x) = p(x) + tr m 1 (x 1+2 3k ) + tr m 1 (x 1+2 5k ) + tr m 1 (x 1+2 6k ) is bent (resp. semi-bent) if and only if gcd(m, 3k) = gcd(m, k), gcd(m, 5k) = gcd(m, k), and gcd(m, 7k) = gcd(m, k).\nRemark 2: As we mentioned in Remark 1, many new generalized boolean bent functions can be constructed like the functions in Corollary 5. Thus, the corresponding new binary bent and semi-bent functions can also be obtained as in Corollary 7.\nNotice that it is difﬁcult to obtain the new binary bent and semi-bent functions f Q (x) of the form (2) constructed in this section based on the theory of quadratic forms over ﬁnite ﬁelds, but we can easily obtain them by the Z 4 -valued quadratic forms and the links between boolean bent and generalized boolean bent functions.\nThe quadratic boolean bent functions and generalized boolean bent functions in polynomial forms are investigated in this paper. New generalized boolean bent functions Q(x) of the form (1) are obtained based on the theory of Z 4 -valued quadratic forms, and a method to construct such functions is also proposed. From these constructions together with the links between generalized boolean bent and boolean bent functions [13], new classes of binary bent and semi-bent functions f Q (x) of the form (2) are presented.\nWe have to point out that many new p-ary bent functions, where p is an odd prime, can also be obtained by applying the same techniques, which are given in the full version of this paper.\nThe authors are grateful to the reviewers for their comments that have improved the presentation of this paper.
