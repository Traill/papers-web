This kind of interference is called generally strong interference. Sufﬁcient conditions for a vector Gaussian interference channel to have generally strong interference are derived.

The noise zzz i is a Gaussian random vector with zero mean and identity covariance matrix; and H i and F i , i = 1, 2, are the channel matrices which are assumed to be known at both the transmitters and receivers. Transmitter i has t i antennas and receiver i has r i antennas. Without loss of generality, we assume H i = 0 and P i > 0.\nThe capacity region of a MIMO IC with strong interference was determined in [1] which requires the existence of matrices A i such that\nfor i = 1, 2, where I is an identity matrix, A T i is the transpose of A i , and A B means that A, B and A − B are all symmetric positive semi-deﬁnite. This result includes the single-input-multiple-input (SIMO) IC [2], and the scalar IC with strong interference [3], [4] both as special cases. It can be shown that the strong interference condition (2) is\nnecessary and sufﬁcient condition for that given in [5] for discrete memoryless ICs, i.e.,\nI (X 1 ; Y 1 |X 2 ) ≤ I (X 1 ; Y 2 |X 2 ) \t (3) I (X 2 ; Y 2 |X 1 ) ≤ I (X 2 ; Y 1 |X 1 ) \t (4)\nare satisﬁed for all input distributions. The capacity region is 0 ≤ R 1 ≤ I (X 1 ; Y 1 |X 2 Q ) \t (5a) 0 ≤ R 2 ≤ I (X 2 ; Y 2 |X 1 Q ) \t (5b)\nAlthough the discrete memoryless ICs, scalar ICs and MIMO ICs all have the same strong interference condition, the same capacity achieving coding scheme and the same ex- pression for the capacity region, an observation about the very strong interference condition leads us to reconsider whether the deﬁnition of strong interference is appropriate. A scalar IC is said to have very strong interference [6] if\nF 2 i ≥ H 2 i 1 + H 2 j P j , i, j ∈ {1, 2}, i = j. \t (6) A MIMO IC is said to have very strong interference [1] if log I + H i S o i H T i ≤ log I + F i S o i F T i I + H j S o j H T j − 1\nand | · | is the determinant of a matrix. The capacity of a Gaussian IC with very strong interference is\nFor the scalar Gaussian IC, the very strong interference con- dition (6) is a special case of the strong interference condition (2) F 2 i ≥ H 2 i . However, for the MIMO IC the very strong interference condition is generally not a special case of strong interference. As an example, we consider a MIMO IC with\nThis MIMO IC has very strong interference, and its capacity region is (8). However, the strong interference condition (2), as well as (3) and (4) for some p (x x x 1 )p(x x x 2 ), are violated.\nThe above inconsistencies motivate us to reconsider more appropriate strong interference conditions than those in [1] and [3]\u2013[5]. Noting that the key is whether or not joint decoding of X 1 and X 2 achieves the capacity, not whether inequalities (3) and (4) are satisﬁed by all input distributions, we deﬁne a new strong interference condition as follows:\nDeﬁnition 1: An IC is said to have generally strong in- terference, if its capacity region is given by (5a)-(5c); or equivalently, if the capacity region is achieved by jointly decoding X 1 and X 2 at each receiver.\nWe focus on only the input distribution and the coding scheme that achieve the boundary of the capacity region, instead of any possible input distributions. Clearly, generally strong interference includes both strong interference and very strong interference as special cases. For the IC with generally strong interference, there may exist input distributions that are not capacity achieving, such that the receiver cannot correctly decode the interference (e.g., the MIMO IC implementing zero-forcing beamforming).\nBesides generally strong interference, we also consider noisy interference which is deﬁned as the condition such that treating interference as noise achieves the capacity. The MIMO IC with noisy interference was studied in [1], [7] and [8]. Speciﬁcally, [1] and [8] obtained different sufﬁcient conditions for noisy interference. When reducing to diagonal channel matrices, [1] and [8] are both special cases of [7]. In this paper, we derive a new set of conditions which include all the above results as special cases and extends upon them. Moreover, we obtain some boundary points of the capacity region of a MIMO Z interference channel (ZIC) which are achieved by treating interference as noise.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We present results for generally strong interference and noisy interference in Sections II and III, respectively. Numerical examples are given in Section IV. We conclude in Section V.\nWe start with the Han and Kobayashi region given by jointly decoding X 1 and X 2 .\nLemma 1: The following region is achievable for a MIMO IC deﬁned in (1):\n      \nR 1 + R 2 ≤ g s 1 (S 1 , S 2 ) R 1 + R 2 ≤ g s 2 (S 1 , S 2 )\n   \nLemma 2: The boundary points of the region deﬁned in (9) are determined by\nwhere R ∗ 1 (r) is the maximum in the following optimization problem:\nsubject to R 1 ≤ g 1 (S 1 ) , r ≤ g 2 (S 2 ) R i ≤ g si (S 1 , S 2 ) − r\ntr (S i ) ≤ P i , S i 0 , i = 1, 2. (13) Furthermore, if S ∗ 1 and S ∗ 2 are optimal for problem (13), then there exist Lagrangian multipliers α i , β i , ν i and K i that satisfy\nα i (R i − g i (S ∗ i )) = 0, α i ≥ 0 \t (14d) β i (R 1 + r − g si (S ∗ 1 , S ∗ 2 )) = 0, β i ≥ 0 \t (14e) ν i (tr (S ∗ i ) − P i ) = 0, ν i ≥ 0 \t (14f) tr (K i S ∗ i ) = 0, \t K i 0 , i = 1, 2. \t (14g)\nProof: The rate pair {R ∗ 1 (r), r } is achievable since it satisﬁes (9). It has to be on the boundary since R ∗ 1 (r) is the maximum of problem (13) given R 2 = r. The Lagrangian conditions are from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theorem.\nLemma 3: The closure of the following set is an outer bound on the capacity region of a MIMO IC:\n      \nR 1 ≤ g 1 (S 1 ) R 2 ≤ g 2 (S 2 )\nR 1 + R 2 ≤ ¯g s 1 (S 1 , S 2 ) R 1 + R 2 ≤ ¯g s 2 (S 1 , S 2 )\n   \nI \t A i A T i \t I\nfor any r i × r j matrix A i , i, j ∈ {1, 2}, i = j satisfying E i 0.\nProof: We only outline the proof due to the space limitations. Suppose that x x x 2 and f f f 1 x x x 1 + n n n 1 are provided to receiver 1 where n n n 1 ∼ N (0, I) is correlated with zzz 1 as E zzz 1 n n n T 1 = A 1 . Computing the sum-rate upper bound of this new channel with average input covariance matrices S 1 and S 2 , we obtain ¯ g s 1 (S 1 , S 2 ). Similarly, we obtain ¯ g s 2 (S 1 , S 2 ).\nNow we obtain the capacity for MIMO ICs with generally strong interference by comparing the inner and outer bounds.\nTheorem 1: Let S ∗ i , i = 1, 2 be maximizers of problem (13) for a given r ∈ 0, max 1 2 log I + H 2 S 2 H T 2 . For i = 1, 2, let β i and K i be the corresponding Lagrangian multipliers satisfying (14a)-(14g). If β j = 0, or if for any β j > 0, j = 1, 2, there exist A i , i = 1, 2, i = j, that satisfy\nwhere O i is deﬁned in (19), then the rate pair {R 1 = R ∗ 1 (r), R 2 = r } is on the boundary of the capacity region, and is achieved by the input distributions x x x i ∼ N (0, S ∗ i ), i = 1, 2, and jointly decoding the signal and the interference.\nProof: We give an outline of the proof. From the outer bound in (15), we ﬁrst formulate an optimization problem similar to (13) to ﬁnd the boundary of the outer bound. Next we show that the new optimization problem is also a convex problem and write the KKT conditions similar to those in Lemma 2 with Lagrangian multipliers ¯ α i , ¯ β i , ¯ ν i and ¯ K i . It can be shown that with the same S ∗ i , if ¯ α i = α i , ¯ β i = β i , ¯ ν i = ν i and\n¯ K i = K i −β j O i , the KKT conditions for the new optimization problem are satisﬁed and the maximum is the same as the maximum in problem (13) under condition (20). Therefore, {R ∗ 1 (r), r } is on the boundary of the capacity region.\nRemark 1: The very strong interference condition (7) im- plies β j = 0. In this case the generally strong interference condition is satisﬁed and we do not need the existence of A i . The strong interference condition (2) implies O i = 0. It is obvious that strong interference may not include very strong interference as a special case, but both are special cases of generally strong interference.\nUsing Theorem 1, we obtain the capacity for multiple-input- single-output (MISO) and SIMO ICs with generally strong interference. We note that any MISO or SIMO IC has the same capacity region as that of a two-antenna MISO or SIMO IC [8] with channel vectors being h h h i and f f f i , or h h h T i and f f f T i , where\nProposition 1: For a MISO IC in the form of (21), let S ∗ i , i = 1, 2, be optimal for problem (13) for a given r ∈\n0, 1 2 log(1 + P 2 ) where H i = h h h T i and F i = fff T i , i = 1, 2; then for i = 1, 2, there exist φ ∗ i ∈ 0, π 2 such that\nwhere τ i = sign(cos θ i ). Furthermore, let R ∗ 1 (r) be the maximum in problem (13), and let β i and K i , i = 1, 2, be Lagrangian multipliers satisfying (14a)-(14g). For any β j > 0, j = 1, 2, j = i, if\nwhere u u u i = [cos φ ∗ i , −τ i sin φ ∗ i ] T , then the rate pair (R ∗ 1 (r) , r) is on the boundary of the capacity region, and is achieved by Gaussian inputs x x x i ∼ N (0, S ∗ i ) and by jointly decoding x x x 1 and x x x 2 .\nProposition 2: For the MISO ZIC in the form of (21) with a 1 = 0, a 2 = a and θ 2 = θ, if a cos 2 θ ≥ 1 + P 1 , then the capacity region is R i ≤ 1 2 log(1+P i ), i = 1, 2, and is achieved by (22) with φ ∗ = θ.\n        \nwhere τ = sign (cos θ), then the following rate pair is on the boundary of the capacity region:\nand the rate is achieved by choosing S as (22) and jointly decoding x x x 1 and x x x 2 at receiver 1.\nThe generally strong interference condition for SIMO ICs is the same as that of strong interference condition.\nThe maximum in the following optimization problem is an achievable sum rate by treating interference as noise:\nThe following lemma gives the necessary KKT conditions for the optimal input covariance matrices S ∗ i , i = 1, 2.\nLemma 4: Let S ∗ 1 and S ∗ 2 be optimal for problem (28). If P 1 , P 2 > 0, then there exist scalars λ i and matrices W i , i = 1, 2, such that for i = 1, 2\nλ i (tr(S ∗ i ) − P i ) = 0, λ i ≥ 0 tr (S ∗ i W i ) = 0, W i 0\nProof: Although problem (28) is a non-convex problem, it still satisﬁes the constraint qualiﬁcations. Thus the above KKT conditions hold.\nThe noisy-interference sum-rate capacity of a MIMO IC is obtained in the following theorem:\nTheorem 2: For the MIMO IC deﬁned in (1) and P i > 0, i = 1, 2, if the optimal solution of problem (28) has tr (S ∗ i ) > 0, and there exist matrices A i and Σ i that satisfy\nand G 1 and G 2 are deﬁned in (29), then the sum-rate capacity is the maximum in problem (28) and is achieved by Gaussian input x x x ∗ i ∼ N (0, S ∗ i ) and treating interference as noise.\nThe proof is similar to that of Theorem 1 and is omitted due to space limitations. Using Theorem 2, we obtain the noisy interference condition for MISO and SIMO ICs.\nProposition 3: For the MISO IC in the form of (21) with cos θ i = 0, fff i = 0, h h h i = 0, i = 1, 2, denote S ∗ i as the optimal solution of problem (28) and S ∗ i is given by (22) with φ ∗ i being maximizers of\ni + τ i φ i ) 1 + a j P j sin 2 φ j\nσ 2 i ≥ ¯σ 2 i , i = 1, 2 \t (36) abs (A 1 ) + abs (A 2 ) ≤ 1 \t (37)\nwhere abs ( ·) denotes the absolute value and for i, j ∈ {1, 2}, i = j\nf f f T j S ∗ j h h h j h h h T j S ∗ j h h h j\nS ∗ i h h h i h h h T i S ∗ i h h h i\nthen the sum-rate capacity is the maximum of problem (28) and is achieved by the input distribution x x x i ∼ N (0, S ∗ i ) and treating interference as noise.\nProposition 4: For the MISO IC in the form of (21) with cos θ 1 = 0, or fff 1 = 0, denote by S ∗ i , i = 1, 2, the optimal solution of problem (28).

The corresponding input covariance matrices are given by (22).\nFigs. 1 and 2 show the maximum or minimum values of a for a MISO ZIC to have generally strong interference or noisy interference.

By Proposition 6, the curve segment AB is on the boundary of the capacity region and is achieved by treating interference as noise.\nWe have determined the generally strong interference ca- pacity region and the noisy-interference sum-rate capacity for MIMO ICs, and have determined some boundary points of the capacity region of MISO ZICs under noisy interference."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"X.
