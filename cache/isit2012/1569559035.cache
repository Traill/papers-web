One stream has stringent delay constraints, while the other stream has a relaxed delay constraint. This is modeled by a block fading channel for the ﬁrst stream, where a broadcast approach is employed. The second stream is encoded over a longer block and views an ergodic fading channel. Several encoding and decoding strategies are considered. In all cases the delay constrained stream is decoded in presence of the other stream, which can be decoded only after its long codeword is fully received. The non-delay constrained part is decoded after canceling out the ﬁrst stream from the received signal. We derive here a closed form solution for the optimal layering power distribution, which maximizes the expected sum- rate, where the layering is employed on the delay constrained stream."},"body":{"text":"Many wireless applications have to cope with transmis- sion of different types of information, which have different priorities. In such case it may be convenient to impose a delay constraint according to the application requirement. For example, a voice communication might not be delay tolerant, while data communications may usually have relaxed delay requirements. Typical delay limited transmissions over a wireless fading channel experience a block fading channel, where the fading realization may vary between transmission blocks. Due to channel variability the transmitter has no access to channel state information (CSI), while receiver has perfect CSI.\nUnder a relaxed delay constraint and long codewords, the transmission experiences multiple fading realizations, which in the limit may achieve the ergodic capacity [1]. Under stringent delay constraints the achievable rate degrades since the transmitter can not foresee the channel realization, and must use a ﬁxed rate. One approach that can be used is known as the Outage Approach [1], where the transmitter sends a single layer encoded stream. When channel conditions allow, receiver reliably decodes the codeword. Otherwise, the decoder declares an outage and the current transmission is rescinded. Another approach is a reﬁnement of the former, known as the Broadcast Approach [2], [3]. The transmission is encoded in multiple ordered layers, each layer is destined to a matched receiver layer. The transmitter virtually broadcasts all layers, and the receiver can decode as much layers as the\ncurrent channel realization allows it. This situation of variable recovered information bits over a ﬁxed block length, obey to the variable-to-ﬁx coding coined and characterized by [4]. The broadcast approach may achieve higher expected rates, and was partially characterized for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) fading channels in [3] and [5].\nThe works [6] and [7] examined the mixed requirement of having two streams of data. One stream is delay constrained (DC), and the other is Non Delay Constrained (NDC), achiev- ing the channel ergodicity. [6] assumed single user MIMO with perfect CSI at receiver and transmitter, while [7] extended this to a multiuser MIMO Broadcast setting. These works focused on a MIMO setting and different streams were assigned to separate channel groups.\nIn this work the DC and NDC streams are transmitted over a single input single output (SISO) channel, with no transmit CSI adhering to the broadcast approach for the DC stream. Three overall strategies are suggested, trying to maximize the expected sum rate. Their achievability region over DC and NDC is examined. The DC is always decoded in presence of the NDC stream, treated as interference. However, before decoding the NDC stream, the decodable DC layers can be removed and allow NDC decoding at highest signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR). A closed-form solution of the sum-rate maximization problem is obtained for the outage and broadcast DC stream in parallel to a single NDC layer. In addition, an NDC layering is introduced and its maximization problem is represented. It is shown that the optimal power distribution for the broadcast approach reduces to the easy-to- implement outage approach in certain conditions. Furthermore, for high SNRs the sum rate is tight to the ergodic capacity bound, and in this case the DC rate is limited to a constant value while the NDC compensates on the gap to ergodic capacity.\nThe structure of the document is as follows. Section II for- mulates the problem and gives some preliminaries. Section III describes DC-Layering with single NDC layer. Optimality for this case is represented at Section IV. Adding to the scheme NDC layering can be found at Section V. Numerical Results are in Section VI, followed by conclusions at Section VII. Throughout the paper proofs are outlined due to space limita- tions. Full details can be found at [8].\nConsider the single user SISO channel Y i =\nS i ·X i + N i , \t i = 1, 2, . . . , ∞ \t (1) where {Y i } are complex samples of the received symbols,\n{X i } are the transmitted complex symbols, and {N i } are the additive circular symmetric complex normal noise samples, i.i.d by (0, 1). S i ∈ R + is the random fading power, which is known only to the decoder. We assume it changes slowly. Without loss of generality, its mean will be normalized, that is ES = 1. The average power at the encoder output is constrained to quantity P ≡ SNR, that is E |X i | 2 ≤ P .\nNotations : For a random variable S, we let F S (s) = Pr {S ≤ s} be the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of S and f S (s) = d ds F S (s) be the probability distribution function (pdf). For some two real values satisfying a < b, let [x] b a be the truncated version of x with respect to the section [a, b], that is [x] b a = max {min {x, b} , a}.\nThe joint strategy of accessing both DC and NDC parts on a single channel uses a two level block nesting. Every L samples deﬁne a block for the DC stream, while the NDC stream is encoded over K such blocks, consisting of L ·K samples. The NDC block is called a super block. L is large enough for reliable communication for the DC part, but is much shorter than the dynamics of the slow fading process. K is large enough for enabling the empirical distribution of the fading coefﬁcient be similar to the real one. Two independent streams of information are encoded. The DC stream is decoded at the completion of each block at the decoder, at a rate dependent upon the realization of the channel fading coefﬁcient for that block. The NDC stream is decoded only at the completion of the super block. All of the following proposed schemes assume superposition coding, equivalent to symbol-wise additivity of the DC and NDC codeletters. Denote by W L the L-length codeword for the DC code for each block, and Z KL the KL- length codeword for the NDC code for each super block. By focusing on one super block and re-indexing (1) we get\ni = 1, 2, . . . , L ; k = 1, 2, . . . , K (2) where the double sub-index {k, i} is equivalent to the time index (k − 1)·L + i. Note that slow fading channel nature was used by deﬁning S k,i = S k . This scheme reﬂects a power constraint of the form E |W k,i + Z k,i | 2 ≤ P . Denote R DC (s) as the achievable rate for a fading power realization s per block. The total expected DC rate over all fading power realizations is by\nLet R N DC designates the rate of the NDC part, which experiences enough such realizations over the communication.\nWhen relaxing the stringent delay constraint, coding over sufﬁcient large blocks can emerge rate of the Ergodic Ca- pacity, deﬁned by C erg = E S [log (1 + SP )]. Clearly, for any scheme R DC + R N DC ≤ C erg .\nThe superposition of DC and NDC is employed by allo- cating a ﬁxed amount of power per stream. Denote the DC relative power portion as β ∈ [0, 1], that is β · P is the power allocated for the DC stream and the rest (1 − β)·P for the NDC stream. The DC part uses the broadcast approach. During decoding of the DC part the NDC is treated as additional interference, since during the decoding of each DC block the NDC codeword cannot be completely received, and thus cannot be decoded nor reconstructed to assist the DC decoding. The NDC decoder is informed of all DC decoded layers per DC codeword and cancels out the decoded part from the corresponding NDC block, maximizing its SINR for NDC decoding.\nBy designing the two encoders like described earlier, we can justify that both DC and NDC parts communicate over a ﬂat fading channel with additive Gaussian noise. The imposed noise for each part consists of the white channel noise along with undecodable codewords of those which are undecoded yet from both parts.\nThe DC encoder uses superposition of inﬁnite number of layers, ordered by means of channel fading realization s in a manner that forms a degraded broadcast channel. Per DC message, the transmitted codeword of length L is by\nDesignate ρ(s) to be the DC layering power distribution, which will be optimized later on, and each layer communi- cation scheme will try to overcome a Gaussian channel where the fading is known to both sides.\nThe NDC encoder sends a single message through block of length L ·K. By random coding over a Gaussian channel, the codewords can be generated. A total of e L ·K·R N DC codewords can be used, where the channel rate R N DC relies on the optimized channel power ρ(s) as well.\nThe decoders are activated by order. First, the DC decoder works on every L-block and by successive decoding can reveal as many layer as the channel permits. It is similar to the classic broadcast approach, except all layers suffer from an undecodable (at this stage) interference.\nAll DC decoders\u2019 outputs are fed to the NDC decoder, which works after K such blocks. After cleaning up per block the decodable DC codewords, the NDC part is decoded with minimal residual interference.\nCalculating the DC rate in presence of NDC is a direct extension of [3], which is a special case for β = 1. Deﬁne the DC interference for a fading power s as I(s), implying\nIt associates the undecodable layers upon a channel fading realization s as noise to the transmission. It is restricted to the total DC allocated power I(0) =\nLemma 1 (Achievable Expected DC Rate). Any total expected DC rate R DC over all fading realizations of the following\nRemark 1. Equation (6) is valid throughout this paper. The cases to come differ in constructing I(s) or splitting the NDC part. Regarding the DC performance, it has no effect.\nProof: (of Lemma 1, Outlined) Fix the instantaneous layer number as j, i.e s (j) = s. The total noise for layer s is i.i.d by CN (0, sI(s) + s(1 − β)P + 1) each time index. By explicitly stating the fractional mutual information between the DC part coded for the layer u and the received signal, given that the channel power realization is s, we derive\nsuccessive decoding, inﬁnitesimally of du, integration and averaging with respect to S\u2019s pdf, (6) evolves.\nLemma 2 (Achievable Expected NDC Rate).

Averaging over enough transmission blocks, each viewing an independent fading realization will give (7).\nIn this section the optimal layering power distribution ρ(s), which maximizes the expected sum rate, is derived. The sum rate refers to the sum of (R DC , R N DC ) as stated in (6) and (7), respectively. It is a function deﬁned over a continuum, and depends on I(s) according to (5). Speciﬁcally, the optimization problem is\nIn the following there are some suboptimal and optimal approaches for ﬁnding I(s).\nThe outage approach is a simple special case of layering, where a single DC coded layer is used. In this case, the power distribution I(s) is explicitly given by\nβP if 0 ≤ s ≤ s th 0 \t if s > s th .\nwhere δ is the Dirac function and s th is a parameter set prior to the communication. s th may be interpreted as the fading gain threshold for single layer coding. The advantages of this approach are low implementation complexity and ease of analysis. The disadvantage is its sub-optimality. The outage approach is designed for a channel with ﬁxed fading of s th . On the one hand, if s ≥ s th , the message can be transmitted errorfree in a rate adjusted for s th . On the other hand, if s < s th , the speciﬁc transmission is useless.\nProposition 1 (Joint Optimality by Outage DC). The maxi- mizer I o (s) of (8) subject to be a descent step of the form (9) has s ∗ th which solves\n)(1 + (1 − β)P s ∗ th ) . (11) The optimal expected DC outage rate and the optimal expected NDC outage rate, which together maximize the sum rate, are\n− β)P u 1 + βP u\nProof: (Outlined) By explicitly describing R DC,o (s) and R N DC,o (s) and averaging, (8) can be changed to depend on some scalar s th ≥ 0 rather then any I(s). Seeking when the derivative is zero results in (11).\nMaximization of (8) can be derived analytically by develop- ing an E¨uler Equation in a similar way to [3]. This is done by enlarging the class of admissible functions I(s) (as opposed to the outage approach) to be continuously differentiable and satisfy the boundary conditions I(0) = βP , I( ∞) = 0.\nProposition 2 (Joint Optimality by Broadcast DC). The max- imizer I bs (s) of (8) when considering all continuously differ- entiable boundary conditioned functions is I bs (s) = [ ˜ I(s)] βP 0 , where\n˜ I(x) = 1 x\nb 2 (x) − 4a(x)c(x) 2a(x)\na(x) = xf S (x) , c(x) = (1 − β) 2 P 2 f S (x)x 3 (15) b(x) = 2(1 − β)P f S (x)x 2 − (1 − F S (x)) \t (16)\nThe associated rates R DC,bs and R N DC,bs can be achieved by placing it in (6) and (7).\nRemark 2 (On possible discontinuity of I(s)). The square root at (14) can impose a ﬁnite length domain for ˜ I(s), that can result in discontinuity of I(s). This situation is addressed by assigning a Dirac function at ρ(s), which can be interpreted as a superposition of single layer coding and continuous layering.\nProof: (Outlined for Proposition 2) Explicitly obtain the functional S(x, I(x), I \u2032 (x)) upon which the target function of (8) is of the form\nS(x, I(x), I \u2032 (x)) dx, where I \u2032 (x) is the derivative of I(s). By [9], a necessary condition for an extremum is given by the corresponding E¨uler-Lagrange equation, i.e. S I − d dx S I \u2032 = 0. For our case it boils down to a quadratic equation, which has a feasible root ˜ I(x) as in (14). The truncation is an outcome of an adaption to the physical meaning of it as a residual interference.\nAdditional gain can be achieved by forming the NDC part as the sum of several layers, each is decoded at different stage. The main idea here is to successively decode the NDC part by jointly decoding residual DC layers, which were originally undecodable on the DC trail. Further decoding of DC layer clearly does not contribute to the expected DC rate, as the DC part is not delay tolerant. However, the NDC decoder may increase its efﬁciency by removing more and more residual interference of the DC part after each NDC layer decoding. Consider\nE Z L q 2 = (1 − β)P . Assuming all codewords are Gaussian distributed, in each stage an additive Gaussian noise is at presence, each time compound from the undecoded codewords. The DC part is decoded in \u201dreal time\u201d. At the completion of a super-block, the decoder removes the impact of the decoded DC codewords. In this stage NDC layers with index greater than or equals 2 play a roll of noise. After canceling the ﬁrst NDC layer, it feeds back DC decoder which now sees less interference at each block. Although it is DC decoding, it is useless for the DC part due to the high latency it imposes. After reliably decoding more DC layers, it can decode another NDC layer. These last two steps can be iteratively repeated, until reaching the last NDC layer.\nExploring the total beneﬁt that can be obtained of such scheme is of interest. To do so, a continuum of decoding stages are deﬁned. The next proposition describes the optimization problem, however it does not seem to lend itself to a closed form solution. Recall only R N DC,bs can be beneﬁcial, since all decoding stages are irrelevant for DC part.\nProposition 3 (Broadcast DC and Broadcast NDC). Any expected NDC rate for multilayer NDC part of the form\nsλ(a) da 1 + sI\nis achievable, for any λ(a) = − d da Λ(a), Λ(0) = (1 −β)P and lim a →∞ Λ(a) = 0. In particular, rate optimization over I(s) and Λ(a) with the boundary conditions can be performed.\nThis proposition is given here without a proof. Further details on its derivation may be found in [8].\nRemark 3. The optimization problem is rather general, hav- ing freedom in choosing I(S) and Λ(a). The DC Rate is independent of Λ(a) since it sees all of it as noise, encouraging us to ﬁnd optimality of DC rate over I(S), and only then to ﬁnd the optimal Λ(a) that maximizes (18).\nThis section demonstrates the expected sum rate results for the Rayleigh ﬂat channel. That is, the random variable fading power S is exponentially distributed with f S (s) = e −s , F S (s) = 1 − e −s , s ≥ 0.\nThe outage approach rates for a Rayleigh fading channel can be obtained by substituting the pdf and cdf at (12) and (13).\nExplicit expressions for the R DC,bs and R N DC,bs were de- rived. They are split over three possible cases and are not shown here due to space limitations.\nFig. 1 shows the relation of R DC + R N DC for the joint outage approach and the joint broadcast approach, for selected values of β. The total expected sum-rate is the sum of the DC rate and the NDC rate, which are presented separately on Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively.\nRemark 4 (On the ﬁnite limit of R DC,bs ). For high SNRs and a ﬁxed β < 1, the NDC rate and the ergodic capacity have the same slope. By analytical calculation, lim P →∞ R DC,bs = −log (1 − β), for β < 1 2 as Fig. 2 shows.\nThis ﬁnding is intuition consistent. Inﬁnite high SNR should give inﬁnite rate for the classic channel, whereas the DC scheme tries to overcome the NDC as well. When SNR is high enough, the DC channel suffers from high NDC noise. As for the NDC decoding, it takes place after DC part is revealed, leading to unlimited rate.\nRemark 5 (On the Optimal DC Layering Power Distribution). For β < 1 2 and P ≥ 4(1 − β)/(1 − 2β) 2 , the optimal DC layering power distribution reduces to the single layer, that is the outage approach. In order to proﬁt from the broadcast approach, the power should be asymmetric in favor for the DC (β → 1).\nThe Achievability region for the single layer NDC at a ﬁxed SNR (P = 25 dB) is in Fig. 4, supports Remark 5.\nThe NDC multi layering scheme is too general. Closed form optimal expressions could not be found even for the NDC 2-Layer (one degree of freedom in Λ(a), where the I(s) was suited solely for DC). By numerical observations, the NDC rate increased by a negligible amount for the numerical optimal Λ(a) at the 2-Layers NDC coding.\nFig. 1: Total rate for several β values and the ergodic capacity vs. the SNR P , for the Flat Rayleigh channel.\nFig. 2: DC rate for several β values vs. the SNR P , for the Flat Rayleigh channel.\nFig. 3: NDC rate for several β values vs. the SNR P , for the Flat Rayleigh channel.\nFig. 4: DC-NDC Achievability Region for single layer NDC at P = 25 dB. The independent variable is β.\nThis paper extends the broadcast approach to the channel model including simultaneous transmission of streams with a mixture of delay constrains. Several schemes were suggested, and analyzed for the SISO ﬂat fading channel. The broadcast approach is superior over the outage only in certain situations under the proposed schemes. This paper focuses on uncoop- erative encoders in parallel to cooperative decoders, whereas the work in [8] also extends the scheme and uses Dirty Paper Coding for the DC part in order to overcome the known non-causal NDC codeword at the role of interference. It also addresses the rate region (R DC , R N DC ), rather than merely focusing on the sum rate optimization as in this paper."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"E. Biglieri"},{"name":"J. G.
