In several such scenarios, interference alignment was used to characterize the degrees-of-freedom of the channel. However, these degrees- of-freedom capacity approximations are often too weak to make accurate predictions about the behavior of channel capacity at ﬁnite signal-to-noise ratios. The aim of this paper is to signiﬁcantly strengthen these results by showing that interference alignment can be used to characterize capacity to within a constant gap.\nWe focus on real time-invariant frequency-ﬂat X-channels, for which only the degrees-of-freedom are known. We propose a new communication scheme and show that it achieves the capacity of the Gaussian X-channel to within a constant gap. To aid in this process, we develop a novel deterministic channel model, admitting a wider range of achievable schemes that can be translated to the Gaussian channel. For this deterministic model, we ﬁnd an approximately optimal communication scheme. We then translate this scheme for the deterministic channel to the original Gaussian X-channel and show that it achieves capacity to within a constant gap. This is the ﬁrst constant-gap result for a fully-connected network requiring interference alignment."},"body":{"text":"Interference alignment has been shown to be a key tech- nique to achieve optimal degrees-of-freedom (capacity pre- log factor) in several common wireless network conﬁgura- tions such as X-channels [1], interference channels [2], [3], multi-user systems with delayed feedback [4], and distributed computation [5], among others. The main idea of interference alignment is to force all interfering signals at the receivers to be aligned, thereby maximizing the number of interference- free signaling dimensions.\nFor time-invariant frequency-ﬂat channels, as considered in this paper, this alignment can be achieved in the signal scale [3], [6]. Using lattice codes, the transmitted and received signals are split into several superimposed layers. The trans- mitted signals are chosen such that all interfering signals are observed within the same layers at the receivers. Signal-scale interference alignment can be subdivided into two different, and seemingly completely unrelated, approaches: alignment schemes motivated by signal-strength deterministic models [6], [7] and real interference alignment [3].\nFor the signal-strength deterministic approach introduced in [8], the channel is ﬁrst approximated by a deterministic noise-free channel. In this deterministic model, all channel\ninputs and outputs are binary vectors, representing the binary expansion of the real valued signals in the Gaussian case. The actions of the channel are modeled by shifting these vectors up or down, depending on the most-signiﬁcant bit of the channel gains, and by bitwise addition over the binary ﬁeld of interfering vectors. The signal layers are represented by the different bits in the binary expansion of the signals. In the second step, the signaling schemes and the outer bounds developed for this simpler deterministic model are used to guide the design of efﬁcient signaling schemes for the original Gaussian problem.\nFor communication scenarios in which interference align- ment is required, this strategy has only been successfully used to obtain constant-gap capacity approximations for the fairly restrictive many-to-one interference channel [6]. Even for the X-channel, one of the simplest Gaussian network in which interference alignment is required, only weaker (gen- eralized) degrees-of-freedom capacity approximations were derived using the deterministic approach [7]. The resulting communication scheme for the Gaussian X-channel is quite complicated and cannot be used to derive a constant-gap capacity approximation.\nFor the real interference alignment approach, each trans- mitter modulates its signal using an integer lattice transmit constellation. The transmit constellations are then scaled by a constant to ensure that at each receiver all interfering lattice constellations coincide, while desired lattice constellations are disjoint. Each receiver recovers the desired signals using a minimum-distance decoder. A number-theoretic result con- cerning the approximability of real numbers by rationals, called Groshev\u2019s theorem, is used to analyze the minimum constellation distance at the receivers. For almost all channel gains, this scheme is shown to achieve the full degrees-of- freedom of the Gaussian X-channel and the Gaussian in- terference channel [3]. While this scheme is asymptotically optimal for almost all channel gains, there are inﬁnitely many channel gains for which the scheme fails, for example when the channel gains are rational. This leads to concerns about the robustness of this approach with respect to channel measurement errors. Moreover, this approach can again not be used to derive stronger constant-gap capacity approximations.\nSome of these concerns follow from the fact that real interference alignment is somehow isolated from other known\nsignaling schemes and only poorly understood. Unlike the signal-strength deterministic approach, no vector space inter- pretation is known for real interference alignment, making it harder to obtain intuition. On the other hand, it is known that the degrees-of-freedom of the interference channel itself is an everywhere discontinuous function of the channel realiza- tions [9]. It should therefore not be surprising that the rates achieved by real interference alignment share this character- istic. Rather, it appears that the degrees-of-freedom capacity approximation is too weak to make accurate predictions about the behavior of channel capacity at ﬁnite signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and that the everywhere discontinuity of the degrees- of-freedom in the channel coefﬁcients are mainly caused by taking a limit as SNR approaches inﬁnity. Thus, a stronger capacity approximation is needed.\nIn this paper, we derive such a stronger capacity approx- imation for the Gaussian X-channel by characterizing its capacity to within a constant gap independent of the SNR and the channel gains, up to an (easily computable) \u201cout- age\u201d set of channel realizations of arbitrarily small measure. In order to obtain this approximation result, we develop a novel deterministic channel model. In this deterministic model, each channel gain is modeled by a lower-triangular binary Toeplitz matrix. The entries in this matrix consist of the ﬁrst\nlog(SNR) bits in the binary expansion of the channel gain in the corresponding Gaussian model. This contrasts with the traditional deterministic model, which is based only on the single most-signiﬁcant nonzero bit in the binary expansion of the Gaussian channel gain. The proposed deterministic model is rich enough to explain the real interference alignment approach. Thus, it unites the so far disparate deterministic and real interference alignment approaches mentioned above.\nThe solution for the proposed deterministic X-channel is simple enough to be mimicked for the original Gaussian channel. We show that this scheme achieves the capacity of the Gaussian X-channel to within a constant gap. To prove achievability for the Gaussian case, we extend Groshev\u2019s theorem to handle ﬁnite SNRs as well as channel gains of different magnitudes. To derive the constant-gap approxima- tion of capacity, we introduced a new outer bound on the sum capacity of the Gaussian X-channel. In addition, we show that, similarly to the Gaussian point-to-point channel, capacity is not sensitive to channel quantization and measurement errors smaller than SNR −1/2 .\nOne implication of these results is that the complicated solution achieving the degrees-of-freedom of the Gaussian X- channel in [7] is a result of oversimpliﬁcation in the signal- strength deterministic model rather than the properties of the original Gaussian channel itself. Moreover, the results in this paper imply that the discontinuity of the degrees-of-freedom of the Gaussian X-channel with respect to the channel coefﬁcients is due to the large SNR limit and is not present at ﬁnite SNRs.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec- tion II formally deﬁnes the Gaussian X-channel and introduces a deterministic channel model approximating it. Section III presents the main results of the paper. Section IV concludes\nDue to space constraints, results are presented here without proof. These can be found in the full version of the paper [10].\nThe Gaussian X-channel consists of two transmitters and two receivers. The channel output y m at receiver m ∈ {1, 2} and time t ∈ N is\ny m [t] 2 n m1 h m1 x 1 [t] + 2 n m2 h m2 x 2 [t] + z m [t], (1) where x k [t] is the channel input at transmitter k ∈ {1, 2}, where 2 n mk h mk is the channel gain from transmitter k to receiver m, and where z m [t] ∼ N (0, 1) is additive white Gaus- sian receiver noise. The channel gains consist of two parts, 2 n mk and h mk . The parameter n mk captures the magnitude or coarse structure of the channel gain, the parameter h mk captures the ﬁne structure of the channel gain. We assume that n mk ∈ Z + and that h mk ∈ (1, 2] for each m, k. Since 2 n mk h mk varies over (2 n mk , 2 n mk +1 ] when h mk varies over (1, 2], we see that any real channel gain greater than one can be written in this form. Channel gains with magnitude less than one are not relevant for a constant-gap capacity approximation, and hence are ignored here. Similarly, negative channel gains have no effect on the achievable schemes and outer bounds presented later, and are therefore ignored as well. In other words, (1) models essentially the general Gaussian X-channel. Denote by\nEach transmitter has one message to communicate to each receiver. So there are a total of four messages, denoted by w mk for m, k ∈ {1, 2}. We impose a unit average power constraint on each transmitted signal. Deﬁne the sum capacity C(N ) of the Gaussian X-channel in the usual way.\nIn the following, we will be interested in a particular mod- ulation scheme for the Gaussian channel, which we describe next. Fix a time slot t; to simplify notation, we will drop in the following the dependence of variables on t whenever there is no risk of confusion. Assume each message w mk is modulated into the signal u mk of the form\nSince |h mk | ≤ 2 and |u mk | ≤ 1/4, this satisﬁes the unit average power constraint at the transmitters.\ny 1 = 2 n 11 g 11 u 11 + 2 n 12 g 12 u 12 + g 10 (2 n 11 u 21 + 2 n 12 u 22 ) + z 1 , y 2 = 2 n 22 g 22 u 22 + 2 n 21 g 21 u 21 + g 20 (2 n 22 u 12 + 2 n 21 u 11 ) + z 2 ,\nSince h mk ∈ (1, 2], we have g mk ∈ (1, 4]. Receiver one is interested in the signals u 11 and u 12 . The other two signals u 21 and u 22 are interference. We see that the interfering signals u 21 and u 22 are received with the same coefﬁcient g 10 . The situation is analogous at the second receiver.\nTo gain intuition for the modulated Gaussian X-channel, we develop a corresponding deterministic channel model. It turns out that existing deterministic models, such as the one introduced by Avestimehr et al. in [8], are not sufﬁcient for the purpose of approximating the Gaussian X-channel. Instead, we introduce a novel deterministic channel model, referred to as lower-triangular deterministic model.\nFor ease of exposition, we assume in the following that the direct links are stronger than the cross links 1 , i.e.,\nFor the deterministic channel model, we will furthermore assume that the channel gains g mk are in (1, 2]\u2014the Gaussian setting will be analyzed for the general case.\nWe construct a deterministic channel with inputs ¯ u mk ∈ Z n kk 2 for m, k ∈ {1, 2} and with channel outputs ¯ y m ∈ Z n mm 2\nfor m ∈ {1, 2}. It will be convenient to split the channel input into \u201ccommon\u201d and \u201cprivate\u201d portions, i.e.,\nwhere ¯ u C m1 ∈ Z n 21 2 and ¯ u C m2 ∈ Z n 12 2 for m ∈ {1, 2}. As we will see shortly, the common portions of the channel input are observable at both receivers, whereas the private portions are only observable at one of the receivers.\nThe proposed lower-triangular deterministic channel be- tween ¯ u mk and ¯ y m is deﬁned as\n     \n[g mk ] 0 \t 0 \t · · · \t 0 \t 0 [g mk ] 1 \t [g mk ] 0 \t · · · \t 0 \t 0\n.. . \t .. . \t . . . .. . \t .. .

Since g mk ∈ (1, 2] by assumption, the diagonal values of ¯ G mk are equal to one. The matrix ¯ G 1k is of dimension n 11 ×n 11 and ¯ G 2k is of dimension n 22 ×n 22 for all k ∈ {0, 1, 2}. A more detailed description and derivation of this lower-triangular deterministic channel model can be found in the full version of the paper [10].\nLet ¯ C(N ) be the sum capacity of the deterministic X- channel (2). Note that, unlike the Gaussian channel, this deterministic X-channel has four channel inputs ¯ u mk , and we impose that there are four corresponding encoders.\nThe main result of this paper is a constant-gap approxima- tion of the capacity of the Gaussian X-channel. To develop intuition, we start with the analysis of the deterministic X- channel. The next theorem provides an approximate charac- terization of the sum capacity ¯ C(N ) of the deterministic X- channel with bit levels N .\nTheorem 1. For every δ ∈ (0, 1] and N ∈ Z 2×2 + such that min{n 11 , n 22 } ≥ max{n 12 , n 21 } there exists a set B ⊆ (1, 2] 2×3 of Lebesgue measure\nsuch that for all channel gains (g mk ) ∈ (1, 2] 2×3 \\ B the sum capacity ¯ C(N ) of the (modulated) deterministic X-channel (2) satisﬁes\nD 1 (N ) (n 12 + n 21 − n 11 ) + + (n 12 + n 21 − n 22 ) + , D 2 (N ) 1 2 n 12 + n 21 + (n 12 + n 21 − n 22 ) + , D 3 (N ) 1 2 n 12 + n 21 + (n 12 + n 21 − n 11 ) + , D 4 (N ) 2 3 (n 12 + n 21 ).\nTheorem 1 approximates the capacity of the modulated deterministic X-channel (2) up to a constant gap for all channel gains g mk ∈ (1, 2] except for a set B of arbitrarily small measure. The event (g mk ) ∈ B can be interpreted as an outage event, as in this case the proposed achievable scheme fails to deliver the target rate of D(N ) − 2 log(c 1 /δ). Here δ parametrizes the trade-off between the measure of the outage event and the target rate: decreasing δ decreases the measure of the outage event B, but at the same time also decreases the target rate D(N ) − 2 log(c 1 /δ). We point out that δ can be chosen independently of the number of input bits N , hence the approximation gap is uniform in N .\nWe now provide a sketch of the communication scheme achieving the lower bound in Theorem 1 (see Figs. 3 and 4).\nObserve that the n 11 −n 21 least-signiﬁcant bits ¯ u P 11 of ¯ u 11 are not visible at the second receiver. Therefore, we can use these bits to privately carry n 11 − n 21 bits from the ﬁrst transmitter to the ﬁrst receiver without affecting the second receiver. The rate of this private message is denoted by ¯ R P 11 . The remaining rate is denoted by ¯ R C 11 , i.e.,\nSimilarly, the n 22 − n 12 least-signiﬁcant bits ¯ u P 22 of ¯ u 22 are not visible at the ﬁrst receiver. Therefore, we can use this part to privately carry n 22 − n 12 bits from the second transmitter to the second receiver without affecting the ﬁrst receiver. The rate of this private message is denoted by ¯ R P 22 . The remaining rate is denoted by ¯ R C 22 , i.e.,\nIt remains to choose the values of ¯ R C 11 , ¯ R C 22 , ¯ R 12 , and ¯ R 21 . Our proposed design rules are as follows.\n\u2022 We dedicate the ¯ R C 11 most-signiﬁcant bits of ¯ u 11 to carry information from transmitter one to receiver one.\n\u2022 We dedicate the ¯ R C 22 most-signiﬁcant bits of ¯ u 22 to carry information from transmitter two to receiver two.\n\u2022 We set the n 22 − n 21 most-signiﬁcant bits of ¯ u 12 to zero. The next ¯ R 12 bits of ¯ u 12 carry information from transmitter two to receiver one. As shown in Fig. 4, this guarantees the (partial) alignment of ¯ u 12 with ¯ u 11 at the second receiver.\n\u2022 We set the n 11 − n 12 most-signiﬁcant bits of ¯ u 21 to zero. The next ¯ R 21 bits of ¯ u 21 carry information from transmitter one to receiver two. As shown in Fig. 3, this guarantees the (partial) alignment of ¯ u 21 with ¯ u 22 at the ﬁrst receiver.\nOptimizing the values of the rates ¯ R mk subject to the condition that both receivers can decode the desired messages, yields the lower bound in Theorem 1.\nGeneralizing these ideas from the deterministic to the Gaus- sian model, we obtain the following constant-gap capacity approximation for the Gaussian X-channel.\nTheorem 2. For every δ ∈ (0, 1] and N ∈ Z 2×2 + such that min{n 11 , n 22 } ≥ max{n 12 , n 21 } there exists a set B ⊆ (1, 2] 2×2 of Lebesgue measure\nsuch that for all channel gains (h mk ) ∈ (1, 2] 2×2 \\ B the sum capacity C(N ) of the Gaussian X-channel (1) satisﬁes\nfor some positive universal constant c 2 , and with D(N ) as deﬁned in Theorem 1. Moreover, the lower bound on C(N ) is achievable with only a max{n mk }-bit quantization of the channel gains h mk available at both transmitters and receivers.\nTheorem 2 provides a constant-gap capacity approximation for the Gaussian X-channel. The constant in the approximation is uniform in the channel gains h mk ∈ (1, 2] except for a set B of arbitrarily small measure, and uniform in N . The event B can again be interpreted as an outage event, and δ parametrizes the trade-off between the measure of the outage event B and the target rate. Since δ can be chosen independently of N , the approximation gap is uniform in the channel SNRs, i.e., uniform in 2 2n mk . Comparing Theorem 2 with Theorem 1, we see furthermore that, up to a constant gap, the Gaussian X- channel and its lower-triangular deterministic approximation have the same capacity.\nThe lower bound in Theorem 2 is achieved by encoders and decoders that have access to only a max{n mk }-bit quan- tization ˆ h mk of the channel gains h mk . These encoders and decoders are mismatched in the sense that they are operating under the assumption that ˆ h mk is the correct channel gain. This shows that the proposed communication scheme is quite robust with respect to channel estimation and quantization errors.\nRemark: It is worth pointing out that the set B in Theorem 2 can be explicitly computed: Given channel gains h mk , there is an algorithm that can determine in bounded time if these channel gains are in the outage set B. More precisely, B is the union of 2 Θ(max{n mk }) strips (see Fig. 5). Membership of (h mk ) in the outage set B is mostly determined by the Θ(max{n mk }) most-signiﬁcant bits in the binary expansion of the channel gains h mk . In particular, for any ﬁnite N\n(and hence ﬁnite channel SNRs), the question of rationality or irrationality of the channel gains h mk is largely irrelevant to determining membership in the outage set B.\nIn this paper, we derived a constant-gap capacity approxi- mation for the Gaussian X-channel. This derivation was aided by a novel deterministic channel model used to approximate the Gaussian channel. In the proposed deterministic channel model, the actions of the channel are described by a lower- triangular Toeplitz matrix with coefﬁcients determined by the bits in the binary expansion of the corresponding channel gain in the original Gaussian problem. This is in contrast to tradi- tional deterministic models, in which the actions of the channel are only dependent on the single most-signiﬁcant bits of the channel gains in the original Gaussian problem. Preserving this dependence on the ﬁne structure of the Gaussian channel gains turned out to be crucial to approximate the Gaussian X-channel by a deterministic channel model.\nThis paper focused on the Gaussian X-channel as an ex- ample of a fully-connected communication network in which interference alignment seems necessary. The hope is that the tools developed in this paper can also be used to analyze more general networks requiring interference alignment. Ultimately, the goal should be to move from degrees-of-freedom capacity approximations to stronger constant-gap capacity approxima- tions."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M. A.
