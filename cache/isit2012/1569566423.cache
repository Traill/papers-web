This paper studies the problem of writing multiple messages into a WOM.

The capacity region is studied and code constructions are proposed for three canonical cases."},"body":{"text":"As part of the tremendous increase in coding research for the ubiquitous ﬂash memories, a considerable attention has been given to rewriting codes. The motivation comes from the special physical properties of the ﬂash memory ﬂoating-gate cells, the most conspicuous of which is the asymmetric pro- gramming behavior of the cells [1]. The memory cells can only increase their level by the injection of electrons to each cell. However, in order to decrease the level of even a sin- gle cell, its entire containing block ( ∼ 10 6 cells) has to be erased. This undesired property not only reduces the writing speed but also signiﬁcantly affects the lifetime of ﬂash mem- ories, which is often speciﬁed in terms of a maximum number of block erasures [1]. As this number can be as low as a few hundreds or thousands, reducing the number of block erasures becomes critical in improving the lifetime of ﬂash memories. The idea of rewriting codes dates back to the pioneer- ing work [10] by Rivest and Shamir on write-once memory (WOM) in 1982. The motivation came from storage media such as punch cards and ablative optical disks. These me- dia are modeled as a collection of write-once binary cells, where each cell is initially in state 0 and can be irreversibly programmed to state 1. Figure 1 shows a typical model for rewriting t times on a binary WOM. An\ndecoders, where decoder i ∈ [1 : t] assigns an estimate ˆ m i = D i (y i ) or an error e to the cell levels y i from the i -th write.\nFig. 1. A t -write WOM model sum-rate optimal if its sum-rate approaches the sum-capacity in the limit. The capacity region as well as the sum-capacity for the WOM model is well studied in the literature [3], [5]; for ex- ample, it is known that the\nt -write sum-capacity is C sum (t) = log 2 (t + 1) and the capacity region is\nFurthermore, many code constructions have been found (e.g., [8], [12], [13]), the sum-rates of which are close to the sum-capacity. Following the work by Rivest and Shamir on the binary WOM, many papers on WOM codes appeared during the 1980s and 1990s, (e.g., [2], [3], [5], [11]) as well as in the past few years (e.g., [4], [6], [8], [9], [12]). Among all of the existing models for rewriting on ﬂash memories, one as- sumes that a new message is stored in the memory on each write, effectively overwriting previously written messages. This can be a drawback in some applications, however, if the user wishes to retain access to one or more previously written messages. For example, suppose that a police station keeps trafﬁc surveillance videos for up to a certain amount of time, say 30 days. This requires that the most current video as well as the videos from the previous 29 days be retrievable at any time. If the entire set of 30 daily videos are treated as a completely new message to be written on top of the exist- ing content of the memory cells, the writing efﬁciency will be low, because the same message is being written multiple times via different codewords. This motivates the model of rewriting ﬂash memories with retained messages. This model is related to the work on buffer\ncodes and trajectory codes [6], [7], which are capable of re- membering the most recent values stored in the memories. To make the problem simple, in this paper we consider rewriting on a binary WOM, where after each write the current message and some of the previously written messages need to be re- trievable. We aim to characterize the optimal rate tradeoff and ﬁnd code constructions focusing on three concrete problems motivated by different scenarios in real storage systems.\nM 0 = ∅ ) and decoder i has to recover both messages. By ignoring the correlation between message pairs over multiple writes and treating\nM i , i ∈ [1 : t − 1], is writ- ten twice. Is this optimal? We establish in Theorem 1 that the sum-capacity of the consecutive two-step WOM model is log 2 t 2 + 1 , which can be twice as large as 1 2 log 2 (t + 1) for large\nt . How can we fully exploit the correlation among messages? We propose in Construction 1 a very simple code, which turns out to be sum-rate optimal. The idea is to parti- tion the set of\nn cells into two blocks and to update the new message alternately on the two blocks, as shown in Table I. An outer bound on the capacity region for general t is also derived.\nNow suppose the police station wishes to keep track of the video from the most recent day on which there was a trafﬁc accident, as well as the trafﬁc video for the current day. Since the trafﬁc accident is unpredictable, we cannot tell which part of the video will be kept for the next day until the end of the current day. This is the situation in which the retrievable message for the next write can be an arbitrary one from the two messages currently written in the memory. To be more concrete, we formulate the problem as follows. Problem 2. Arbitrary two-step WOM\nOn the ﬁrst write, encoder 1 stores message M 1 and decoder 1 has to recover M 1 . On the i -th write, i ∈ [2 : t] , encoder i stores\n(M s(i) , M i ) , where M s(i) ∈ {M s(i−1) , M i−1 } is arbi- trarily chosen from the two messages stored on the (i − 1) -st write, and decoder\nFor this problem, an idea arises naturally from the construc- tion for the consecutive two-step WOM. With Table I in mind, we store M 1 and M 2 the same way as before for the ﬁrst two writes. If\n(M 1 , M 3 ) is stored on the third write, we update M 3 on block 2. If instead (M 2 , M 3 ) is stored on the third write, we update\nroughly 1 2 log 2 (t) in the worst case scenario. Can we do better than this? In Section III, we construct a code by enlarging the number of blocks, and we show that it can strictly outperform the above code. Moreover, it is shown to be asymptotically optimal in t . A simple outer bound on the capacity region and an upper bound on the sum-capacity are also presented.\nNow we introduce the last problem. Suppose the surveil- lance videos are layered as high-ﬁdelity and low-ﬁdelity ones, e.g., encoded by the H.264 standard. On each day, all low- ﬁdelity videos from previous days and the high-ﬁdelity video from the current day should be stored. This motivates the fol- lowing.\nM i , i ∈ [1 : t] , as two independent parts: the common message M c i ∈ [1 : 2 nR c i ] and the private message\nOne extreme special case of this problem is M c i = ∅, i ∈ [1 : t] , i.e., there is no common message. Then we go back to the traditional\nt -write WOM. The other extreme special case is M p i = ∅, i ∈ [1 : t] , i.e., there is no private message. Since all the previously written messages have to be recoverable by the current decoder, the performance is fundamentally limited by the last write. It can be shown that the capacity region for this extreme problem is t i=1 R i 1 . Thus, an obvious choice to maximize the sum-rate is to set all the common-message rates to be zero and the sum-capacity is readily established as log 2 (t + 1) . In Section IV, we establish the optimal trade-off between the common-message sum-rate\nR c 2 = R p 2 = · · · = R c t = R p t = R . Since the problem formulation is apparently a combination of two completely solved extreme problems, one might think that a time-sharing strategy between the two optimal coding schemes would be optimal. Surprisingly, in Section IV, we construct a code that strictly outperforms the time-sharing code and is asymptotically optimal in t . The performance of this construction is illustrated in Figure 2.\nIn this section we establish the sum-capacity as well as an outer bound and an inner bound on the capacity region for the consecutive two-step WOM deﬁned in Problem 1. Proposition1. (Outer bound on the capacity region) If a rate tuple (R 1 , R 2 , . . . , R t ) is achievable for the t -write consecu- tive two-step WOM, it must satisfy\nt , let s = t/2 .

It also serves as part of the proof for Proposition 2. Partition the set of all cells into two blocks and write odd mes- sages to one block on odd writes and even messages to the other block on even writes, as shown in Table I. Thus, each block of cells can reliably store\n(M i−1 , M i ) stored in the two blocks. Construction 1 Let t and n be positive integers, with t even, and let\ni ∈ [1 : t] , are (y \u2032 i , y \u2032\u2032 i ) , where y \u2032 i and y \u2032\u2032 i denote blocks of lengths λn and (1 − λ)n , respectively. Let C 1 be a\nC of length n is constructed as follows. The cells are partitioned into block 1 with length λn and block 2 with length\n¯ λn . On the i -th write, the encoder i assigns the codeword x i = (x \u2032 i , x \u2032\u2032 i ) as follows: 1) For odd\ni = 2j − 1 , write message m i ∈ [1 : 2 nR i ] to block 1 using the encoder on the j -th write from C 1 and keep block 2 unchanged, i.e.,\ni = 2j , write message m i ∈ [1 : 2 nR i ] to block 2 using the encoder on the j -th write from C 2 and keep block 1 unchanged, i.e.,\n. It can be seen that C is a consecutive two-step WOM code. If\nIII. A RBITRARY T WO -S TEP WOM In this section we study the arbitrary two-step WOM de- ﬁned in Problem 2. Note that if a WOM code C is a t -write arbitrary two-step WOM code, then we can construct from it a t -write consecutive two-step WOM code. Therefore, the sum-capacity\nC 2 sum (t) C 1 sum (t) = log 2 ( t 2 + 1) . Now we give a construction that strictly outperforms the construction in the introduction and achieves 2/3 of C 1 sum (t) of the consecutive two-step WOM, while keeping track of ar- bitrary messages as required. Partition the set of all cells into three blocks as illustrated in Table II. In the ﬁrst two blocks, we write in the exactly same manner as for the consecutive two-step WOM. The third block is updated with\nM s(i) every other write to help retrieve the desired message of the arbi- trary demand. This can be improved by further enlarging the number of blocks as given in Construction 2.\nℓ . The cells consist of ℓ + 1 blocks, each of size n \u2032 ; thus n = n \u2032 (l + 1) . After the i -th write, i ∈ [1 : t] , the cell levels are\nj -th block of length- n \u2032 cells. Let C W be an [n \u2032 , t/ℓ; 2 n \u2032 R \u2032 1 , . . . , 2 n \u2032 R \u2032 t/ℓ ] WOM code of length n \u2032 with encoder\nC is constructed, where R i = R \u2032 ⌈i/ℓ⌉ , i ∈ [1 : t] .

Otherwise, the last block is kept unchanged. Proposition3.

To illustrate the basic idea, we show a construction for t = 3 . Suppose that every pri- vate/common message represents\nk = nR bits. Partition the n cells into three blocks. Write M c 1 to the ﬁrst block. Parti- tion\nM p 1 into two messages M p 11 with λk bits and M p 12 with (1 − λ)k bits. Write M p 11 and M c 2 to the second block and M p 12 , M p 2 , (M c 3 , M p 3 ) to the third block. Thus, in the ﬁrst block we use a one-write WOM code, in the second block we use a two-write WOM code and in the third block we use a three- write WOM code, as illustrated in Table III.\nn = n 1 + n 2 + n 3 as a function of λ . Now we state the construction formally and then present the symmetric sum-rate analysis.\nConstruction 3 Let k be a positive integer, λ ∈ [0, 1] , and n 1 = k . Suppose that the cell levels after the i -th write are (y \u2032 i , y \u2032\u2032 i , y \u2032\u2032\u2032 i ) , where y \u2032 i , y \u2032\u2032 i , and y \u2032\u2032\u2032 i denote blocks of length n 1 , n 2 , and n 3 , respectively. Let C 1 be an [n 1 , 1; 2 k ] WOM code with encoder\nE \u2032 1 (m 1 ) for the ﬁrst write, C 2 be an [n 2 , 2; 2 λk , 2 k ] WOM code with encoders E \u2032\u2032 i (m i , y \u2032\u2032 i−1 ) , i ∈ [1 : 2] , for the ﬁrst two writes, and\nC 3 be an [n 3 , 3; 2 (1−λ)k , 2 k , 2 2k ] WOM code with encoder E \u2032\u2032\u2032 i (m i , y \u2032\u2032\u2032 i−1 ) , i ∈ [1 : 3] , for all three writes. An\n[n, 3; (2 k , 2 k )] symmetric incremental WOM code C is constructed. On the i -th write, encoder i assigns the codeword\nC 1 , write message m p 11 ∈ [1 : 2 λk ] to block 2 using the encoder for the ﬁrst write from C 2 , and write message m p 12 ∈ [1 : 2 (1−λ)k ] to block 3 using the encoder for the ﬁrst write from\nC 2 , and write message m p 2 ∈ [1 : 2 k ] to block 3 using the encoder for the second write from C 3 , i.e.,\nn 3 (λ) is the minimum length of an [n 3 , 3; 2 (1−λ)k , 2 k , 2 2k ] WOM code. Then, the problem is to ﬁnd the value of\nProposition4. The minimum value of n in Construction 3 is n = 4.386k , which is achieved by setting λ = 0.3116 . The corresponding symmetric sum-rate is\nProof: Let us ﬁrst ﬁnd the value of n 2 (λ) . That is, we ﬁnd a WOM code of minimum length n 2 (λ) such that its rate on the ﬁrst write is\n{(R 1 , R 2 )|R 1 h(p 1 ), R 2 p 1 , for some p 1 ∈ [1/2, 1]} , and we ﬁnd a WOM code of minimum length, the ratio of R 1 and\n( 1 ) always has a solution, which we denote by p 1 (λ) . Now, we deduce from R 2 = k/n 2 = p 1 that\np 2 p 3 , for some p 2 , p 3 ∈ [1/2, 1]} . Thus, it can be shown that the values of p 2 , p 3 ∈ [1/2, 1] that give the minimum code length for\nThe value of p 3 is independent of λ and is given by p 3 = 0.9055 , and p 2 (λ) is the solution to equation ( 2 ) . Hence, n 3 (λ) satisﬁes\nn 3 (λ) = 2k/((p 2 (λ)p 3 ) . We are now left to solve the minimization problem minimize 1 p\n, \t (4) with λ ∈ [0, 1] , where p 1 (λ), p 2 (λ), and p 3 satisfy equa- tions\n( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) respectively. From Equation ( 3 ) , p 3 was already calculated numerically. From Equation\nTherefore, we can formulate the minimization problem as minimize 1 p\nThis completes the proof. We are now ready to generalize the construction for an arbitrary number of writes t .
