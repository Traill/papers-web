While supplying full diversity, these codes also possess a lattice structure which incurs a high complexity of Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding, typically implemented with a sphere decoder [2]. A line of research on fast-decodable codes initiated in [3] yielded several families of codes with reduced ML decoding complexity, notably in [4]\u2013 [6], where different notions of fast-decodability are studied and categorized. Codes for the Multiple Input Double Output (MIDO) channel have been of special interest due to their potential application to digital video broadcasting, where the number of receive antennas is limited by the size of the user\u2019s portable device. In particular, several constructions of fast-decodable MIDO codes have been proposed [7]\u2013[9]. Se- quences of fast-decodable codes when the number of transmit antennas increases can be found in [10].\nIn this paper, we are similarly interested in addressing the design of fast-decodable codes for possibly large number of transmit antennas, and present an iterative construction of minimum delay algebraic space-time codes - generalizing the method proposed in [11] - which generates for each i ≥ 1 a family of fast-decodable full-rate MIDO 2 i × 2 i codes.\nEach code in this family is a full-rate MIDO code contained in the ring of 2 i × 2 i matrices M at 2 i ×2 i (K) with coefﬁcients in a number ﬁeld K. At each step of the iteration, the resulting space-time code actually carries an algebra structure, and we supply criteria which determine when this algebra is division, or alternatively put, when the code is fully diverse. It is worth highlighting that the matrix representation of these codes is not\nthe left regular representation typically employed in the area [1]. While codes arising from a division algebra are no novelty, the iterative nature of this construction endows the resulting codes with fast-decodable properties. This is achieved using a scaling technique, which allows us to preserve fast-decodable properties of the initial code throughout the iterative process.\nThe sketch of our construction is as follows. Let D be a division algebra contained in the ring M at n×n (K) of n × n matrices with coefﬁcients in a number ﬁeld K (in this context, the property of being division means that every matrix in D is invertible). We provide a general construction which allows us to embed the algebra D into a bigger algebra A = A(D) ⊂ M at 2n×2n (K). Given that the initial algebra D was division, a criterion decides when the algebra A is also division. The process can thus be repeated, starting with A(D) instead of D to construct a sequence of division algebras, whose elements are matrices with coefﬁcients in K. At each stage of the iteration, a new fully-diverse space-time code is derived from the corresponding division algebra.\nFor each integer i ≥ 1, let T = 2 i denote the number of Tx antennas. We consider transmission over a coherent Rayleigh fading channel with T Tx antennas, 2 Rx antennas and perfect channel state information at the receiver (CSIR):\nwhere H is the 2 × T channel matrix, V is the 2 × T Gaussian noise at the receiver, and X ∈ C i is a T ×T codeword that can be represented as a linear combination g 1 B 1 + · · · + g r i B r i of generating matrices B 1 , . . . , B r i of the code C i , weighted by coefﬁcients g 1 , . . . , g r i , which are PAM information symbols. The matrices B 1 , . . . , B r i will sometimes be referred to as a basis of the code C i and r i as the rank of the code. For each i ≥ 1, we construct a code C i ⊂ M at 2 i ×2 i (K), such that the R-rank r i of each iterated code is 2 i+2 . Since each codeword can transmit up to 4T = 2 i+2 PAM information symbols (equivalently 2 i+1 complex symbols), the resulting codes are full-rate MIDO codes. Alternatively, in terms of number of complex symbols per channel use (cspcu), the proposed codes are of rate two for each i, which is maximal for a MIDO code. Maximum-likelihood decoding amounts to searching the code\nclosest to the received matrix Y with respect to the squared Frobenius norm. Each 2 × T matrix HB j corresponds, via vectorization, to a vector b j ∈ R r i obtained by stacking the columns followed by separating the real and imaginary parts of HB j . We deﬁne the (generating) matrix\narg min{||y − Bg|| 2 E } g∈S ri = arg min{||Q ∗ y − Rg|| 2 E } g∈S ri (3)\nwith respect to the Euclidean norm, where y is the vectoriza- tion of Y , and R is an upper right triangular matrix obtained through the QR decomposition B = QR, with Q unitary.\nThe number and position of nonzero elements in the upper right part of R determine the complexity of the sphere decod- ing [3]: if r i is the number of independent real information symbols from S within one codeword from C i , then the ML decoding complexity is the minimum number of values of g used in (3) while performing ML decoding. The worst case, when the matrix R is a full upper right triangular matrix, is the complexity of the exhaustive-search ML decoder, that is O(|S| r i ), where |S| is the number of PAM symbols in use. Fast decodability is achieved whenever the code structure is such that the decoding complexity has an exponent κ i of |S| smaller than r i . We call κ i the complexity order of the code.\nGiven an ordered basis B 1 , . . . , B r i , we can determine the zero structure of R by the zero structure of the matrix M , deﬁned by orthogonality relations of the basis elements:\nM k,l = ||B k B ∗ l + B l B ∗ k || F . \t (4) It was shown in [4, Lemma 2] that if M has the form\nwhere ∆ is a d-dimensional diagonal matrix, then the matrix R of the QR decomposition in the sphere decoder as in (3) satisﬁes\nA code C i corresponding to such an R has complexity order κ i = r i − d + 1. It was also proven in [4, Lemma 10] that the matrix R has the form\n \n \n \n \nA code C i with such a matrix R is said to be g-group decodable and has complexity order κ i = max 1≤j≤g d j .\nWe start with a 4-dimensional algebra D 1 , and obtain a sequence D 1 , D 2 , D 3 , . . . of division algebras with D 1 ∈ M at 2×2 (K), D 2 ∈ M at 4×4 (K), D 3 ∈ M at 8×8 (K), etc. For i ≥ 1, the code C i corresponding to D i is a subset of the matrix ring M at 2 i ×2 i (K) for some number ﬁeld K. A codeword in C i encodes 2 i+2 real symbols (i.e., 4 real symbols pcu).\nWe describe the general iterative step ﬁrst. Let K be a number ﬁeld, and D be a division algebra contained in the ring M at n×n (K) of n × n matrices over K (n is some 2 i at the ith iteration). Given an automorphism τ of K, we extend it to a homomorphism of D (still denoted by τ by abuse of notation) by pointwise action on K-coefﬁcients of elements of D, i.e., for a matrix A ∈ D ⊂ M at n×n (K), we have\nNote that τ (A)τ (B) = τ (AB), hence τ (A −1 ) = τ (A) −1 for A invertible . In our construction τ will have to in fact be an automorphism of D, i.e., satisfy τ (D) = D.\nWe next deﬁne a map α θ which embeds D × D into a larger ring. Given an element θ of the center Z(D) of D, let α θ : D × D → M at 2×2 (D) be the map deﬁned by\nwhich is seen as an embedding of D × D into M at 2n×2n (K). For this construction to be iterative, A := α θ (D, D) needs\nto again be a division algebra. We start with a criterion which determines when A has the structure of a Z(D)-algebra 1 . The question of whether it is division is discussed below.\nLemma 1: Let τ be an automorphism of K of order 2, which extends to an automorphism of D and ﬁxes its center pointwise, i.e., τ (z) = z for z ∈ Z(D). If θ ∈ Z(D), then the image A of α θ forms an algebra of dimension 2d 2 over Z(D), where d 2 is the dimension of D over its center.\nProof: Note that A = α θ (D, D) is both additively and multiplicatively closed, since clearly\nusing that τ (θ) = θ, since τ ∈ Z(D), and τ 2 = 1. The center of D embeds into the center of A via\nSince A is additionally a vector space over Z(D), it has the structure of a Z(D)-algebra. It is of dimension 2d 2 over Z(D).\nWe now give a criterion on θ which guarantees that the Z(D)-algebra A = α θ (D, D) is division, in other words every nonzero element of A is invertible. The following lemma is a slight generalization of [11, Lemma 1].\nLemma 2: Let D be a division algebra, whose elements correspond to n × n matrices over a ﬁeld K. Let τ and θ satisfy the hypothesis of Lemma 1. Then A = α θ (D, D) is division if and only if θ = zτ (z) for all z ∈ D.\nProof: Suppose that θ = zτ (z) for all z ∈ D. We will show that A is division. Consider a nonzero element\nwhere the entries x, y are n × n matrices from the division algebra D. If x = 0 (resp. y = 0), the matrix is clearly invertible. Let us thus assume that both x, y ∈ D are nonzero, hence invertible. The formula (sometimes referred to as Schur complement) for the determinant of a block matrix gives\nNow since τ (x) − yx −1 θτ (y) ∈ D, and hence invertible when nonzero, we have\nIt thus sufﬁces to demonstrate τ (x) − yx −1 θτ (y) = 0. Since y is invertible, and recalling that for x ∈ D, τ (x −1 ) = τ (x) −1 , the latter inequality is equivalent to xy −1 τ (xy −1 ) = θ. Letting z = xy −1 , by our assumption on θ, we have θ = zτ (z). Hence det(α θ (x, y)) = 0.\nConversely, suppose θ = zτ (z) for some z ∈ D. We verify that det(α θ (z, I n )) = 0, where I n is the identity matrix. Indeed\n= det(z) det(τ (z) − I n z −1 zτ (z)) = det(z) det(0) = 0.\nLet us now detail how the above general iterative construc- tion induces a family of space-time codes, by ﬁxing for the ﬁrst step (i=1) an algebra D 1 of dimension 4.\nLet F be a number ﬁeld, and let D 1 = (a, b) F be a generalized quaternion algebra [12]. By deﬁnition, D 1 is of dimension 4 over its center F , and has for maximal subﬁeld K = F (\nis that elements of D 1 can be viewed as 2 × 2 matrices over K via left regular representation, namely:\nand c, d ∈ K. The code C 1 consists of the subset of D 1 , whose coefﬁcients c, d are algebraic integers of K. When F is an imaginary quadratic of Q, each symbol from F corresponds to 2 rational symbols. Hence each codeword carries 2 K- symbols, that is 4 F -symbols, or 8 Q-symbols. The rank r 1 of the code C 1 is hence 8. Restricting the symbols in F to be algebraic integers means that the 8 Q-symbols are in Z.\nFirst we note that τ is of order 2, and extends to an automorphism of D 1 :\nis in D 1 , since τ (b) = b. Adding that τ (z) = z for every z ∈ Z(D 1 ) = F , we can use it for the iterative step in α θ .\nIndeed, this is an element of D 1 since τ (θ 1 ) = θ 1 . The ﬁrst step of the iteration gives us the algebra D 2 = α θ (D 1 , D 1 ) whose elements are matrices of the form\n  \nc bτ (d) θ 1 τ (e) θ 1 bf d τ (c) θ 1 τ (f ) θ 1 e e bτ (f ) τ (c) \t bd f τ (e) \t τ (d) \t c\n  \nThe code C 2 is obtained as the image α θ 1 (C 1 , C 1 ) of C 1 . Similarly, the second step gives the algebra D 2 whose elements are 8 × 8 matrices of the form\nA θ 2 τ (B) B τ (A)\nwhere A, B ∈ D 1 and θ 2 is an element of F , possi- bly equal to θ 1 . Continuing, we obtain an iterative se- quence of algebras D i = α θ i−1 (D i−1 , D i−1 ), whose elements are in M at 2 i ×2 i (K). The corresponding codes are C i = α θ i−1 (C i−1 , C i−1 ). From Lemma 2, θ i , i ≥ 1 must satisfy\nWe now deﬁne a scaled version ˜ α θ of the map α θ , which will be useful in constructing fast-decodable codes from the iterated construction. Recall the map α θ deﬁned in (5):\nwhere τ and θ are as in the assumptions of Lemma 1 to ensure that α θ (D, D) has a Z(D)-algebra structure.\nLet u, v, x, y ∈ D be n × n matrices with coefﬁcients in K. We denote by ζ a 4rth root of unity, it does not have to be\nprimitive, that is ζ ∈ {±1, ±i}. Let θ = ζθ with θ > 0 , we have that the map\n√ θ τ (v) √\nsatisﬁes that det(α ζθ (u, v)) = det( ˜ α ζ √ θ (u, v)), for all u, v. In particular, the image of ˜ α retains the full diversity property.\nFurthermore, assuming that complex conjugation commutes with τ on elements of D, and letting ˜ α denote ˜ α ζ √ θ for short, one can easily check that\nFrom the calculations above, we can see how the fast decodable properties of the code C with underlying algebra D are inherited by the iterated code coming from A(D), as we summarize in the lemma below.\nLemma 1: Let D be a code with basis {D 1 , . . . , D r }. Then { ˜ α(D j , 0), ˜ α(0, D k ) : 1 ≤ j, k ≤ r} is a basis of A(D). Moreover, if the orthogonality relation\nholds for a pair (j, k), then the following orthogonality rela- tions hold for the basis of A(D) above:\nThe corresponding code built over the algebra A(D) thus enjoys the same orthogonality relations, meaning that with each iteration i the worst case increase in complexity order is 2 i . This gives the following (very) loose bound.\nCorollary 1: Let D i be an iterated code with complexity order κ i . Then κ i+1 ≤ 2 i + κ i .\nWe provide a detailed example, using as ﬁrst code the Silver code. The Silver code, discovered in [13], and rediscovered in [14], is given by codewords of the form\nA basis for the Silver code is given by {B j , j = 1, . . . , 8}, and a Silver codeword X can be written as\nwhere x j = x j1 + ix j2 , and x j1 , x j2 ∈ Z are PAM symbols. Fixing such an ordering of the basis yields an R matrix [4]\nwhere ∆ is a 4-dimensional diagonal matrix, thus inducing a complexity order of κ 1 = 8 − 4 + 1 = 5. A. First iteration\nTo perform the ﬁrst iteration, we need to identify the structure of a quaternion algebra. Consider F = Q(\n−7) and its Galois extension K = F (i), with Galois automorphism τ : a + bi → a − bi, where a, b ∈ F . Note that τ is not the complex conjugation since it ﬁxes\n−7. Silver codewords can also be viewed [15] as (scaled) matrices of the form\nd τ (c) , \t (10) where c, d ∈ Z[i] ⊕ Z[i]( 1+ √ −7 2 ). To be more speciﬁc, the Silver code is obtained via left regular representation of the elements of the natural order of the quaternion algebra D 1 = (−1, −1) F . Thus for a pair of algebraic integers c, d ∈ Q( √ −7, i) we have a Silver codeword (10) arising from D 1 . The automorphism τ of order 2 extends to D 1 via\nNoting that τ (z) = z for every z ∈ Z(D 1 ) = F , we can use τ for the iterative construction.\nGiven θ 1 ∈ Z(D 1 ), the ﬁrst iteration D 2 = α θ 1 (D 1 , D 1 ) of the Silver code is given by matrices looking like\n  \na −τ (b) θ 1 τ (c) −θ 1 d b τ (a) θ 1 τ (d) θ 1 c c −τ (d) τ (a) \t −b d τ (c) \t τ (b) \t a\n  \nTo make the corresponding code C 1 fully diverse, by Lemma 2, we need to check that zτ (z) = θ 1 , for any z ∈ D 1 , that is, writing z as in (10)\nc −τ (d) d τ (c)\ncτ (c) − τ (d) 2 = θ 1 c(d + τ (d)) = 0,\nwhich we do not want simultaneously satisﬁed for any choice of c, d ∈ K. By choosing c = 0, we obtain the ﬁrst condition:\nfor any d ∈ K. Suppose c = 0. Then for d = d 1 +id 2 , the 2nd equality is satisﬁed only when d 1 = 0. Thus assume d 1 = 0, in which case we need that cτ (c) − τ (d) 2 = θ 1 for d = id 2 . Write c = c 1 + ic 2 , this is equivalent to checking\n7). For example, θ = −17 satisﬁes the two conditions above. Clearly, θ/−1 = 17 is not a square in K. For the second condition, by reducing modulo the ideal I = ( 1+\n) 3 O F , we see that θ ≡ −1 mod I, which we verify is not a sum of three squares mod I.\nBy picking θ 1 of the form a positive multiple of a 4rth root of unity, D 1 will inherit orthogonal relations from D 1 , as explained in III-C. In fact, by being more restrictive and picking θ 1 to be of the form −θ with θ > 0, one can get a better fast-decodability than what predicted in III-C, which is what we illustrate now. In that case, the left upper part of the R matrix that is obtained is of the form\n  \nR 1 0 \t 0 \t 0 0 R 2 0 \t 0 0 \t 0 R 3 0\n  \nshowing that R is 4-group decodable, once half of the symbols are decoding, showing a complexity order of κ 2 = 10. Note that this was already observed in the case of θ = −1 in [11], though in this case the algebra cannot be division.\nLet θ 3 be an element of Z(D 2 ). We can deﬁne the second iteration D 3 = α θ 3 (D 2 , D 2 ), whose elements are 8×8 matrices with entries in K of the form\nwhere A, B are elements of D 2 described in (11). To determine whether D 3 is division, Lemma 2 is applied similarly as in the ﬁrst iteration. A minimum gain in fast-decodability is ensured using the technique given in Subsection III-C, however, as shown for the ﬁrst iteration, a more careful analysis could reveal more than the minimal gain predicted.\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel method to construct space-time codes from division algebras, where instead of using the classical left regular representation, we combine space-time codes in small dimension in an iterative manner. Techniques involving building codes from smaller ones have\nbeen studied, however by exploiting the structure of algebraic space-time codes, we show here that we can derive conditions that generate a sequence of algebras, which can be division. Furthermore, we explain how the bigger code can inherit fast- decodability properties from the smaller codes.\nFuture work involves a more thorough investigation of the code parameters involved, as well as simulations to determine which code instances are giving the best performance, in terms of diversity, fast-decodability, and coding gain.\nThe research of N.
