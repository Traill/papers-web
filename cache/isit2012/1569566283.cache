We capture the broadcast nature of wireless networks but assume no interference for the multiple access. This is not true in general, but it can be realized through the multiplexing of time, frequency or code. Given such a scenario, the problem can be stated as: What is the optimal relay position that maximizes the multicast ﬂow from s to T ? Similarly, we can also ask: What is the optimal relay position that minimizes the cost (in terms of total network power) for a feasible target multicast ﬂow F ?\nA fairly general class of acyclic hypergraphs are considered. Given a ﬁnite set of nodes N positioned on a 2-D Euclidean plane the hypergraph G(N , A) is characterized by the follow- ing rules of construction of the hyperarcs in the set A:\n1) A transmit node i ∈ {s, r} has a radio range and the set of nodes lying inside it are given by T i ⊂ T . A hyperarc (i, V i ) emanating from i connects to a set of receivers (or end nodes) V i ⊂ N \\{i} in its radio range.\n2) Each hyperarc is associated with a rate function that is convex and increasing in transmit node power and decreasing in distance between the transmit node and the farthest end node of the hyperarc. Each end node v ∈ V i spanned by the hyperarc (i, V i ) can decode the\ninformation sent over the hyperarc equally reliably, i.e. all the end nodes in V i get the same rate.\nThe construction rules capture the distance-based broadcast approach, e.g. time sharing for broadcasting is a special case of the above construction rules that is also capacity optimal. In relation to the special case of our hypergraph model, the authors addressed the ﬁrst question (of max-ﬂow) in the con- text of the Low-SNR Broadcast Relay Channel in [1], [2]. This paper generalizes it in two major directions. First, we solve the joint relay positioning and max-ﬂow optimization problem for the hypergraph model characterized above involving a fairly general class of rate functions and present efﬁcient algorithms that solve the problem. Second, we address the min-cost ﬂow problem and establish a duality relation between the max-ﬂow and min-cost problems in terms of optimal relay positioning and present an algorithm that solves an important special case of the min-cost problem.\nThe relay positioning problem has been studied in various settings [3]\u2013[5]. In most cases, the problem is either heuris- tically solved due to inherent complexity, or approximately solved using simpler methods but compromising accuracy. We reduce the joint non-convex problem into an easily solvable sequence of two decoupled problems. The ﬁrst problem solves for optimal relay position in a purely geometric sense with no ﬂow optimization involved. Upon obtaining the optimal relay position the second problem addresses the ﬂow optimization.\nSection II develops the wireless network model. Section III presents the key multicast ﬂow concentration ideas for max- ﬂow and min-cost ﬂow that are central to the reducibility of the joint problem. In Section IV, we present algorithms solving the problems, and ﬁnally we conclude in Section V.\nConsider a hypergraph G(N , A) consisting of |N | nodes placed on a 2-D Euclidean plane with |A| hyperarcs. The set N = {s, r, t 1 , .., t n } consists of a source node s, a relay r and an ordered destination set T = {t 1 , .., t n } (in increasing distance from s). The node positions on the 2-D Euclidean plane are denoted by the set of two-tuple vectors Z = {z i = (x j , y j )|∀j ∈ N }. The only positionable node is the relay r.\nTo motivate our model, we review the Low-SNR Achievable Hypergraph Model that was developed and presented in [1].\nA. Low-SNR (Wideband) Broadcast and MAC Channel Model Consider the AWGN Low-SNR (wideband) Broadcast\nChannel with a single source s and multiple destinations T = {t 1 , .., t n }. From [6] and [7], we know that for broad- casting superposition coding is equivalent to time sharing, and is optimal. Implying that the broadcast communication from a single source to multiple receivers can be decomposed into communication over n hyperarcs sharing the common source power. Therefore, we get the set of hyperarcs A bc = {(s, t 1 ), (s, t 1 t 2 ), .., (s, t 1 t 2 ..t n )} (refer Figure 1).\nFurthermore, in the Low-SNR (wideband) regime inter- ference becomes negligible with respect to noise, and all sources can achieve their point-to-point capacities analogous to Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA). In general, the MAC Channel consisting of n sources s 1 , ..., s n transmitting to a common destination t can be interpreted as n point-to- point arcs. Thus, we get A mac = {(s 1 , t ), .., (s n , t )}. Due to the linearity of hyperarc capacity in SNR, each hyperarc (s, t 1 ..t j ) ∈ A bc ∪ A mac is associated with the rate function\nwhere t j is the farthest end node of the hyperarc from s, α ≥ 2 is the path loss exponent and N 0 is the channel noise variance.\nBy concatenating the Low-SNR Broadcast Channel and MAC Channel models we obtain an Achievable Hypergraph Model, for instance the Broadcast Relay Channel consisting of a single source, n destinations and a relay. Although, time sharing and FDMA are capacity achieving schemes, the Achievable Hypergraph Model is not necessarily capacity achieving. In contrast, it is easy to scale to larger and complex networks which is practically important.\nFor simplicity, throughout this paper we will assume that all the nodes lie in the radio range of s and r for any arrangement of the nodes N on the plane, and that both transmitters use time-sharing based broadcasting. As there are only two transmitters in the system, i.e. s and r, for a given position of r and assuming (without loss of generality) the arrangements of node sets {t 1 , .., r, .., t n } and {t \u2032 1 , .., t \u2032 n } in increasing order of distance from s and r, respectively, the sets A s = {(s, t 1 ), (s, t 1 t 2 ), .., (s, t 1 ..r ), .., (s, t 1 ..r..t n )} and A r = {(r, t \u2032 1 ), (r, t \u2032 1 t \u2032 2 ), .., (s, t \u2032 1 ..t \u2032 n )} of hyperarcs emanating from s and r can be constructed easily by the using the simple construction rules stated in the previous section. Here, the set {t \u2032 1 , .., t \u2032 n } is simply the destination set T arranged in increasing order of distance from r. Consequently, the set of hyperarcs is given by A = A s ∪ A r (refer Figure 1).\nAny hyperarc (u, V k u ) ∈ A is associated with a rate func- tion R u v ku = f (P u v ku , D uv ku ), where P u k u and D uv ku denotes the fraction of the total transmit node power allocated for the\n(e) \t (f ) (a) \t (b) \t (c)\nhyperarc and the Euclidean distance between transmit node u and the farthest end node v k u ∈ V k u from u, respectively.\nWe assume that the hyperarc rate function R u v ku is increas- ing and convex in power P u v ku and decreasing in D uv ku . Furthermore, we write the hyperarc rate function into two separable functions of power and distance\nh (D uv ku ) \t (2) where g : R + −→ R + is increasing and convex and h : R + −→ R + is increasing. This separation can be assumed, without loss of generality as the results in this paper are valid for any rate function R u v ku = f (P u v ku , D uv ku ), where f is increasing and convex in power and decreasing in distance and in general is not separable and if the inverse function f −1 (mapping the range of f to its domain) exists. Moreover, to comply with standard physical wireless channel models we assume that\n∂D uv ku , \t (3) ∀(P u v ku = D uv ku ) ∈ dom(P u v ku , D uv ku ). Inequality (3) implies that if the variables P u v ku and D uv ku approach inﬁnity at the same rate, then the rate function R u v u −→ 0. Moreover, if the functions g and h are not differentiable entirely in dom (P u v\n) and dom(D uv ku ), respectively, then Inequality 3 can be rewritten with partial sub-derivatives, which implies that differentiability is not imperative for the results presented.\nDenote the convex hull of the nodes in N \\{r} by C. For a given relay position z r ∈ C, let L i = {l i 1 , .., l i τ i } be the set of paths from s to a destination t i ∈ T and let L = {l 1 , .., l τ } be the set of paths from s that span all the destination set T , therefore L ⊂ i ∈[1,n] L i . Moreover, any path in the system consists of either a single hyperarc or at most two hyperarcs as there are only two transmitters in the system and G(N , A) is acyclic. Let µ and ν denote the total given power of the source and relay, respectively, and γ = ν µ denote their ratio, where γ ∈ (0, ∞). Denote with F l i\nand F i the ﬂow over the path l i j (for j ∈ [1, τ i ]) and the total ﬂow to the destination\n. Deﬁne F to be the the multicast ﬂow from s to the destination set T as the minimum among the total ﬂows to each destination, then for a given relay position z r ∈ C the multicast max-ﬂow problem can be written as,\n∈ C(P, D), ∀j ∈ [1, τ i ], ∀i ∈ [1, n]. (5) The hyperarc rate constraints and node sum-power constraints are denoted by the set C (P, D) in Program (A) for simplicity. Program (A) in general is non-convex.\n≥ 0. The cost of rate R u v ku is given by the total power consumed by the hyperarc to achieve R u v ku\nwhere g −1 : R + −→ R + is the inverse function of g that maps its range to its domain. Therefore, the total cost of multicast ﬂow F is simply the sum of powers of all the hypearcs in the system. Note that the function g −1 is increasing and concave, and if h is convex then from Inequality (3) g −1 ◦ h increasing and convex. So for a given relay position z r ∈ C, the min-cost problem minimizing the total cost for setting up the multicast session (s, T ) with a target ﬂow F can be written as,\n≥ 0, ∀j ∈ [1, τ i ], ∀i ∈ [1, n]. (8) Constraint (7) makes sure that any destination t i ∈ T receives a minimum of ﬂow F . Like in Program (A), we denote with the set C (P, D) the hyperarc rate and power constraints.\nFinally, deﬁne the point p ∗ , that will be crucial in developing algorithms in later sections,\nwhere, µ ∗ = g(µ) and ν ∗ = g(ν). An intuitive way to understand p ∗ is that if µ ∗ = ν ∗ = 1 then p ∗ is the circumcenter of two or more nodes in the set N \\{r}. Note that the program in Equation (9) is a convex program, and ﬁnally D p ∗ denotes the optimal value of the objective function.\nHereafter, we represent with (s, T, Z, γ) and (s, T, Z, γ, F ) the joint relay positioning and ﬂow optimization problem instances that maximizes the multicast ﬂow and minimizes the total cost for a the target ﬂow F , and with z ∗ γ ↑ and z ∗ F ↓ denote the optimal relay positions, respectively. Note that the optimal relay position z ∗ γ ↑ is characterized by the power ratio γ and the optimal relay position z ∗ F ↓ is characterized by the target ﬂow F .\nIn this section we develop fundamental multicast ﬂow prop- erties that govern the multicast ﬂow in the wireless network hypergraphs that we consider in this paper. First, we brieﬂy note the main hurdles in jointly optimizing the problem. For a given problem instance different relay positions can result in different hypergraphs, which makes the use of standard graph-based ﬂow optimization algorithms difﬁcult. Moreover, the hyperarc rate function can be non-convex.\nWe will show that the joint problems (s, T, Z, γ) and (s, T, Z, γ, F ) can be reduced to solving a sequence of two decoupled problems. The reduced problems are decoupled in the sense that the ﬁrst problem is purely a geometric optimization problem and involves no ﬂow optimization and vice versa for the second problem. At the same time, they are not entirely decoupled because the two problems cannot be solved separately. Now we present a series of results that are fundamental to the reducibility of the joint problem.\nProposition 1: The optimal relay positions z ∗ γ ↑ and z ∗ F ↓ lie inside the convex hull C.\nRefer to Appendix A in [8] for the proof. Proposition 1 tells us that only the points inside the polygon C need to be considered. This brings us to the next fundamental theorem.\nTheorem 1 (Flow Concentration): Given the problem in- stance (s, T, Z) and z r ∈ C:\n(i) the maximized multicast ﬂow F ∗ concentrates over at most two paths from s to the destination set T .\n(ii) for any target ﬂow F ∈ [0, F ∗ ] the min-cost multicast ﬂow concentrates over at most two paths from s to T .\nThe proof of Theorem 1 is detailed in Appendix B of [8]. Essentially, Theorem 1 tells that for a given relay position z r ∈ C, the multicast ﬂow F goes only over the paths that span all the destination set T , i.e. set L. Furthermore, among the paths in L, the maximized multicast ﬂow F ∗ goes over only two paths, namely the path L ∋ ˆl 1 = {(s, T 1 ), (r, T 2 )} that has the highest min-cut among all the paths through the relay r, and path L ∋ ˆl 2 = {(s, t 1 , .., t n ) = (s, T )}, which is the biggest hyperarc from s spanning all the destination set T , here r ∈ T 1 and T 1 ∪ T 2 = T . The same holds for the min- cost case for a given relay position z r ∈ C. Consequently, it is also true for the optimal relay positions z ∗ γ ↑ and z ∗ F ↓ . Hereafter, we only need to consider the ﬂow over paths ˆ l 1 and ˆl 2 (corresponding to the relay position in consideration).\nAssuming that the transmitted signal propagates omni- directionally, we can geometrically represent the hyperarcs of the path ˆ l 1 = {(s, T 1 ), (r, T 2 )} by circles C s T 1 and C r T 2 cen- tered at s and r with radii π s = D st k and π r = D rt k\u2032 (where D st k = max t i ∈T 1 (D st i ) and D rt k\u2032 = max t j ∈T 2 (D rt j )), re- spectively. Similarly, the path ˆ l 2 = {(s, T )} can be represented by the circle C s T with radius D st n . Also, C ∪ = C s T 1 ∪ C r T 2 denotes the union region of the two circles. Then using\nt 2 \t t 3 ¯ r\nwhere, P s T 1 , P r T 2 and P s T are the powers for hyperarcs of the paths ˆ l 1 = {C s T 1 , C r T 2 } and ˆl 2 = {C s T }, respectively. The radii variables π s and π r correspond to path ˆ l 1 for the relay position z r ∈ C such that z r ∈ C s T 1 and Z ∈ C ∪ . Although Program (C) is substantially reduced using Theorem 1, it is still a non- convex optimization problem. The objective function is non- convex and different positions of the relay z r ∈ C result in different end node sets T 1 and T 2 for the hyperarcs of path ˆ l 1 .\nOn the other hand, we know that the relay position is sensitive only to the ﬂow over path ˆ l 1 . Therefore, the optimal relay position maximizing the ﬂow only over the path ˆ l 1 results in global optimal relay position solving (s, T, Z, γ). This fact combined with the independent power constraints for the ﬂow over the path ˆ l 1 motivates the decoupling optimal relay position from the ﬂow maximization.\nProposition 2: For a given problem instance (s, T, Z, γ), if for a close enough point p ǫ on the perpendicular bisector ⊥ jn to p ∗ the following holds R ∗ p ǫ < R ∗ p ∗ , then z ∗ γ ↑ = z p ∗ .\nRefer to Appendix C in [8] for the detailed proof. ⊥ jn de- notes the perpendicular bisector of the points t j and t n , where t j is the farthest node in T from t n . At point p ∗ , in general the following holds g (µ) h (π p∗\n(from Equation (9)), thus making it naturally a good candidate for z ∗ γ ↑ . Proposition 2, shows that the point p ∗ is essentially a good lower bound on the maximized multicast rate R ∗ p ∗ ≤ R ∗ . In addition, if positioning the relay close enough to p ∗ at point p ǫ (in the direction closer to the source s) on the perpendicular bisector ⊥ jn decreases the maximized multicast rate, i.e. R ∗ p ǫ < R ∗ p ∗ , then it can be proven that z ∗ γ ↑ = z p ∗ . The general case is covered in the next section.\nLet us now see the problem in a different way. Consider π s ∈ (0, D st n ) and construct the hyperarc C s π s . Denote by T \u2032 = {t j ∈ T |D st j > π s }, the set of destination nodes that lie outside the hyperarc circle C s π s . Then compute r such that\nand position the relay at r (here r is the point in C s π s such that the maximum among the distances to the nodes in the set T \u2032 from r is minimized). If D sr < π s , then we contract the hyperarc C s π s to C s r , else we simply re-denote it with C s r . Finally, we can construct the hyperarc C r t n ( note that Z ∈ C \u2032 ∪ = C s r ∪ C r t n ). Interestingly, the set R \u2032 of points r computed in this way for different values of π s ∈ (0, D st n ) are the optimal relay positions z ∗ γ ↑ solving (s, T, Z, γ) for some γ ∈ (0, ∞). Figure 2(a) captures this interesting insight of the relationship between the points r and z ∗ γ ↑ . Note that the set R of points r is a discontinuous piecewise linear segment.\nThe min-cost problem (s, T, Z, γ, F ) can be re-written as Minimize (P s T 1 + P r T 2 + P s T ) \t (D)\nh (D st n ) , (10) P s T 1 + P s T ≤ µ, P r T 2 ≤ ν. \t (11)\nHere, F ∈ [0, F ∗ ]. From Theorem 1, we know that paths ˆl 1 and ˆ l 2 carry all the min-cost target multicast ﬂow F . For convenience, we will refer the path ˆ l 1 as the cheapest path for a unit ﬂow among all the paths through r in L for given position of relay. We claim that z ∗ F ↓ ∈ R, to see this let ˆl 1 = {C s T 1 , C r T 2 } be the two hyperarcs of path ˆl 1 corresponding to the relay position z ∗ F ↓ . Then, z ∗ F ↓ must satisfy\nOtherwise, we can position the relay at the point z ∗ r ∈ C s T 1 solving the right hand side of Equation (12), further reducing the total cost for the target ﬂow F contradicting the optimality of z ∗ F ↓ . Therefore, z ∗ F ↓ (like z ∗ γ ↑ ) always lie on on the curve R. This observation motivates an interesting fundamental relationship between z ∗ F ↓ and z ∗ γ ↑ .\nz ∗ F ↓ = z ∗ γ ↑ , \t (13) where γ ∈ [min(γ, γ), max(γ, γ)] and z ∗ 1↓ = z ∗ γ ↑ .\nTheorem 2 establishes the underlying duality relation be- tween the max-ﬂow and min-cost problem in terms of optimal relay position. Implying that the optimal relay position z ∗ F ↓ solving the problem (s, T, Z, γ, F ) is also the optimal relay position z ∗ γ ↑ solving the problem (s, T, Z, γ) for some γ. The proof of Theorem 2 is presented in Appendix D of [8].\nOn the other hand, the min-cost problem (s, T, Z, γ, F ) is not always reducible to a sequence of decoupled problems. This is beacause the path ˆ l 2 can be cheaper than path ˆ l 1 for a unit ﬂow corresponding to the optimal position z ∗ F ↓ , i.e.\nas almost all wireless network models that comply with our model result in the hyperarc cost function g −1 (h(D uv ku )) being the increasing convex function of distance D uv ku that satisfy Inequality (14). If Inequality (14) holds, then similar to the Max-ﬂow problem the joint optimal relay positioning and min-cost ﬂow optimization problem in Program (D) can be reduced to a sequence of decoupled problems of computing the optimal relay position and then optimizing the hyperarc powers to achieve the min-cost ﬂow F in the network using the similar arguments as in previous subsection.\nIn this section we present the general max-ﬂow and min-cost (for problem instances satisfying Equation (14)) algorithms that solve the sequence of decoupled problems.\n1: Compute p ∗ , if R ∗ p ǫ < R ∗ p ∗ (for p ǫ ∈⊥ jn ), output z ∗ γ ↑ = z p ∗ , F ∗ = g(ν)h(D sp ∗ ) and quit, else go to 2.\n< D p ∗ t \u2032 j } = {t \u2032 1 , .., t \u2032 j \u2032 } (ordered in increasing distance from s) and compute p ∗ T \\T \u2032 . If D st \u2032\nThe Max-ﬂow Algorithm in Figure 3 is a simple 3 step (non-iterative) algorithm that outputs the optimal relay position and the maximized multicast ﬂow. The ﬁrst step is essentially Proposition 2, if it does not hold the second step ﬁlters the redundant nodes that are too close to the source and can be ignored. If the ﬁrst and second step are not satisﬁed, then the third step divides the computation of z ∗ γ ↑ into two regions of C and outputs the better one. The proof of optimality is provided in Appendix E of [8].\nWe present the Min-cost Algorithm for a special case of (s, T, Z, γ, F ), that is when the Inequality (14) holds and at the optimal relay position z ∗ F ↓ all the target ﬂow goes over path ˆl 1 . This special case corresponds to satisfying Proposition 2 for the Max-ﬂow problem. Min-cost Algorithm in Figure 4, unlike the Max-ﬂow algorithm, is an iterative algorithm. In the ﬁrst step the geometric feasibility region is constructed and in the second step this region is divided into at most n − 1 sub- regions. Refer Appendix F of [8] for the proof of optimality.\nbuild the set T = {t ∈ T |D st ≤ D sp }.

We reduce the hard joint relay positioning and ﬂow (max-ﬂow/min-cost) optimization problem to a sequence of simple decoupled problems.\nAs a part of future work it would be of interest to extend the work presented here to the general multicommodity setting where multiple sessions use a set of relays."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M.
