Started in the 1950s in the form of ripple control for load and tariff management in power distribution, this low bandwidth one-way communication system evolved to a two- way communication system in the 1980s. With the emergence of the Internet in the 1990s, research into broadband PLC gath- ered pace as a promising technology for Internet access and local area networking, since the electrical grid infrastructure provides \u201clast mile\u201d connectivity to premises and capillarity within premises. Recently, there has been renewed interests in high-speed narrowband PLC due to applications in sustainable energy strategies, speciﬁcally in smart grids (see [1]\u2013[4]).\nHowever, overcoming permanent narrowband disturbance has remained a challenging problem [5]\u2013[7]. Vinck [5] ad- dressed this problem by showing that multiple frequency shift keying (MFSK) modulation, in conjunction with the use of a permutation code having minimum (Hamming) distance d, is able to correct up to d − 1 errors due to narrowband noise. Since then, more general codes such as constant-composition codes, frequency permutation arrays, and injection codes (see [8]\u2013[23]) have been considered as possible replacements for permutation codes in PLC. Versfeld et al. [24], [25] later intro- duced the notion of \u2018same-symbol weight\u2019 (henceforth, termed as symbol weight) of a code as a measure of the capability of a code in dealing with narrowband noise. They also showed empirically that low symbol weight cosets of Reed-Solomon codes outperform normal Reed-Solomon codes in the presence of narrowband noise and additive white Gaussian noise.\nUnfortunately, symbol weight alone is not sufﬁcient to cap- ture a code\u2019s performance against narrowband noise. Chee et\nal. [26] introduced an additional parameter that more precisely captures the narrowband noise error-correcting capability. This parameter is related to symbol equity, the uniformity of fre- quencies of symbols in each codeword. Codes designed taking into account this new parameter have been shown to perform better than general ones [26].\nRelatively little is known about optimal equitable symbol weight codes, other than those that correspond to injection codes (which include permutation codes) and frequency per- mutation arrays (FPAs). In particular, only six inﬁnite families of optimal equitable symbol weight codes with code length greater than alphabet size are known. These have all been constructed by Ding and Yin [15], and Huczynska and Mullen [21] as frequency permutation arrays and they meet the Plotkin bound. One drawback with the code parameters of these families is that the relative narrowband noise error-correcting capability diminishes to zero as its length grows.\nIn this paper, we construct the ﬁrst inﬁnite families of optimal equitable codes, whose code lengths are larger than alphabet size and whose relative narrowband noise error- correcting capabilities tend to a positive constant as code length grows. These families of codes all attain the Plotkin bound. Our results are based on the construction of equivalent combinatorial objects called generalized balanced tournament designs.\nOwing to space constraints, some proofs are omitted here. These will appear in the full version of the paper.\nLet Σ be a set of q symbols. A q-ary code of length n over the alphabet Σ is a subset C ⊆ Σ n . Elements of C are called codewords . The size of C is the number of codewords in C. For i ∈ [n], the ith coordinate of a codeword u ∈ C is denoted u i , so that u = (u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u n ).\nDenote the frequency of symbol σ ∈ Σ in codeword u ∈ Σ n by w σ (u), that is, w σ (u) = |{u i = σ : i ∈ [n]}|.\nAn element u ∈ Σ n is said to have equitable symbol weight if w σ (u) ∈ { n/q , n/q } for any σ ∈ Σ. If all the codewords of C have equitable symbol weight, then the code C is called an equitable symbol weight code.\nConsider the usual Hamming distance deﬁned on codewords and codes and let d denote the minimum distance of a code C. Consider the following parameter.\nDeﬁnition 2.1: Let C be a q-ary code with minimum dis- tance d. The narrowband noise error-correcting capability of C is\nThe relative narrowband noise error-correcting capability is then given by γ(C) = c(C)/n.\nChee et al. [26] established that a code C can correct up to c(C) − 1 narrowband noise errors and demonstrated that an equitable symbol weight code maximizes the quantity c(C), for ﬁxed n, d and q. Henceforth, only equitable symbol weight codes are considered. A q-ary equitable symbol weight code of length n having minimum distance d is denoted (n, d) q -equitable symbol weight code. The maximum size of an (n, d) q -equitable symbol weight code is denoted A E q (n, d). Any (n, d) q -equitable symbol weight code of size A E q (n, d) is said to be optimal.\nTaken as a q-ary code of length n, an optimal (n, d) q - equitable symbol weight code satisﬁes the Plotkin bound [27].\nTheorem 2.1 (Plotkin Bound): For n, q, d such that d ≤ n and qd > (q − 1)n, A E q (n, d) ≤ qd/(qd − (q − 1)n).\nIn this paper, equitable symbol weight codes whose sizes attain the Plotkin bound are constructed.\nMain Theorem: Let q ≥ 2. Then the following holds. (i) A E q (2q − 1, 2q − 2) = 2q for all q ≥ 3;\n(iii) A E q (4q − 1, 4q − 4) = 4q for all q ≥ 5, except possibly when q ∈ {28, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 44};\n(iv) A E q 3q−1 2 , 3q−3 2 = 3q for all odd q ≥ 7, A E 3 (4, 3) = 6 and A E 5 (7, 6) = 14.\nObserve that any equitable symbol weight code C with the above parameters must have c(C) = q − 1. It can be veriﬁed that γ(C) tends to a positive constant as q grows. Known values of A E q (n, d) are:\nIn particular, only six inﬁnite families of optimal codes with n > q are known. However, the code parameters for these six families are such that their relative narrowband noise error-correcting capabilities diminish as q grows. This is undesirable for narrowband noise correction in PLC. Hence, Main Theorem provides the ﬁrst inﬁnite families of equitable symbol weight codes with code lengths greater than alphabet size and whose relative narrowband noise error-correcting capabilities tend to a positive constant as length grows.\nOur construction of optimal equitable symbol weight codes employs tools from combinatorial design theory. The rest of this section introduces the necessary concepts and establishes their connections to equitable symbol weight codes.\nA set system is a pair S = (X, A), where X is a ﬁnite set of points and A ⊆ 2 X . Elements of A are called blocks. The order of S is the number of points in X, and the size of S is the number of blocks in A. Let K be a set of nonnegative integers. The set system (X, A) is said to be K-uniform if |A| ∈ K for all A ∈ A.\nA (v, k, λ)-balanced incomplete block design , or BIBD(v, k, λ), is a {k}-uniform set system (X, A) of order v, such that every pair of distinct points is contained in exactly λ blocks. The size of a BIBD(v, k, λ) is λv(v−1) k(k−1) . A resolvable BIBD(v, k, λ), or RBIBD(v, k, λ), is a BIBD(v, k, λ) (X, A) such that A can be partitioned into resolution classes , each of which is a partition of X.\nDeﬁnition 2.2: A generalized balanced tournament design (GBTD) is an RBIBD(km, k, λ) (X, A) whose m · λ(km−1) k−1 blocks are arranged into an m × λ(km−1) k−1 array such that:\n(ii) each point appears either λ(km−1) m(k−1) or λ(km−1) m(k−1) times in each row.\nWe remark that our deﬁnition of a generalized balanced tournament design extends that of Lamken [29], which cor- responds to the case λ = k − 1 in our deﬁnition.\nC. Equivalence Between Equitable Symbol Weight Codes and GBTDs\nConsider a GBTD λ (k, m) (X, A) whose rows are indexed by [m] and columns by [n], where n = λ(km−1) k−1 . Given any point x and any column j, there is a unique row that contains x in column j. Hence, for each x, we correspond the codeword c(x) = (r 1 , r 2 , . . . , r n ) ∈ [m] n , where r j is the row where x appears in column j. So, C = {c(x) : x ∈ X} is a code of length n over the alphabet [m]. Note that this correspondence is the one used by Semakov and Zinoviev [30] to show the equivalence between equidistant codes and RBIBDs.\nFor distinct points x, y ∈ X, the distance between c(x) and c(y) is the number of columns for which x and y are not both contained in the same row. Since there are exactly λ blocks\ncontaining both x and y, and no two such blocks can occur in the same column, the distance between c(x) and c(y) is n − λ = λk(m−1) k−1 . This distance is independent of x and y, making C equidistant.\nNext, we consider the composition of c(x) for x ∈ X. From the construction, the number of times a symbol i appears in c(x) is the number of cells in row i that contains x. By the deﬁnition of a GBTD λ (k, m), this number is in { n/m , n/m }, so C is an equitable symbol weight code. We check that the size of C attains the Plotkin bound.\nFinally, this construction of an equitable symbol weight code from a generalized balanced tournament design can easily be reversed. We record these observations as:\n-equitable symbol weight code of size km. Furthermore, this code is of equitable symbol weight and attains the Plotkin bound.\nThe following theorem summarizes the state-of-the-art re- sults on the existence of GBTD k−1 (k, m).\n(i) A GBTD 1 (2, m) exists if and only if m = 1 or m ≥ 3. (ii) A GBTD 2 (3, m) exists if and only if m = 1 or m ≥ 3.\n(iii) A GBTD 3 (4, m) exists for all m ≥ 5, except possibly when m ∈ {28, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 44}.\nMain Theorem (i)\u2013(iii) is now an immediate conse- quence of Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3. The existence of GBTD λ (k, m) when λ = k − 1 has not been previously investigated. The smallest open case is when k = 3 and λ = 1, which we deal with here.\nIt follows readily from deﬁnition that a necessary condition for a GBTD 1 (3, m) to exist is that m must be odd. A quick exhaustive computer search showed that a GBTD 1 (3, 3) and a GBTD 1 (3, 5) do not exist. In fact, we have A E 3 (4, 3) = 6 and A E 5 (7, 6) = 14, which do not meet the Plotkin bound. Hence, a GBTD 1 (3, m) can exist only if m is odd and m / ∈ {3, 5}. We prove that this necessary condition is also sufﬁcient. A direct consequence of this is Main Theorem (iv). Since a GBTD 1 (3, 1) exists trivially, we focus on m ≥ 7.\nOur proof of the existence of a GBTD 1 (3, m) for all odd m ≥ 7 is technical and rather complex. This section out- lines the general strategy used, and introduces some required combinatorial designs. As with most combinatorial designs, direct construction to settle their existence is often difﬁcult. Instead, we develop a set of recursive constructions, building big designs from smaller ones. Direct methods are used to construct a large enough set of small designs on which the recursions can work to generate all larger designs.\nFor our recursion to work, the GBTDs must possess more structure than stipulated in its deﬁnition. More speciﬁcally, we consider GBTDs that are special and ∗colorable.\nDeﬁnition 3.1: A \t special \t GBTD 1 (3, m) \t is \t a GBTD 1 (3, m) such that there exists a special cell for\nwhich the block it contains is disjoint from all other blocks in the same row.\nDeﬁnition 3.2: Let c be a positive integer. A c-∗colorable RBIBD(v, 3, 1) is an RBIBD(v, 3, 1) with the property that its v(v − 1)/6 blocks can be arranged in a v 3 × v−1 2 array, and each block can be colored with one of c colors so that\n(ii) in each row, blocks of the same color are pairwise disjoint.\nDeﬁnition 3.3: A GBTD 1 (3, m) is c-∗colorable if each of its blocks can be colored with one of c colors so that in each row, blocks of the same color are pairwise disjoint.\nDeﬁnition 3.4: A 3-∗colorable RBIBD(v, 3, 1) is 3- ∗colorable with property Π if there exists a row r such that for each color i, there exists a point (called a witness for i) that does not appear in that row, or is not contained in any block in that row that is colored i. A GBTD 1 (3, m) that is c-∗colorable with property Π is similarly deﬁned.\nProposition 3.1: If an RBIBD(v, 3, 1) is 2-∗colorable, then it is 3-∗colorable with property Π.\nDeﬁnition 3.5: Let (X, A) be a set system and let G = {G 1 , G 2 , . . . , G s } be a partition of X into subsets, called groups . The triple (X, G, A) is a group divisible design (GDD) when every 2-subset of X not contained in a group appears in exactly one block, and |A ∩ G| ≤ 1 for all A ∈ A and G ∈ G.\nWe denote a GDD (X, G, A) by K-GDD if (X, A) is K-uniform. The type of a GDD (X, G, A) is the multiset\n|G| : G ∈ G . The exponential notation is sometimes used to describe the type of a GDD: a GDD of type g t 1 1 g t 2 2 · · · g t s s is a GDD where there are exactly t i groups of size g i , i ∈ [s].\nDeﬁnition 3.6: A transversal design TD(k, n) is a {k}- GDD of type n k . A doubly resolvable TD(k, n), denoted DRTD(k, n), is a TD(k, n) whose blocks can be arranged in an n × n array such that each point appears exactly once in each row and once in each column.\nand |G i | ≡ 0 mod 6 for all i ∈ [s]. Let R = 1 3 s i=1 |G i | and C = 1 2 s i=1 |G i |. Suppose there exists a partition [R] =\nR i and a partition [C] = s i=1 C i such that for each i ∈ [s], we have |R i | = |G i |/3 and |C i | = |G i |/2. We say that (X, G, A) is a frame generalized balanced tournament design (FGBTD) if its blocks can be arranged in an R × C array such that the following conditions hold:\n(ii) for any row r ∈ R i , each point in X \\ G i appears either once or twice and the points in G i do not appear,\n(iii) for any column c ∈ C i , each point in X \\ G i appears exactly once.\nDenote this FGBTD by FGBTD(3, T ), where T = |G i | : i ∈ [s] .\nProposition 4.1 (Tripling Construction): Suppose there ex- ist a 3-∗colorable RBIBD(m, 3, 1) and a DRTD(3, m). Then there exists a 2-∗colorable GBTD 1 (3, m). Furthermore, if the RBIBD(m, 3, 1) is 3-∗colorable with property Π, then the GBTD 1 (3, m) is a special GBTD 1 (3, m).\nCorollary 4.1: Let m > 3 and suppose there exists an RBIBD(m, 3, 1) that is 3-∗colorable with property Π. Then there exists a special GBTD 1 (3, 3 k m), for all k ≥ 0.\nFGBTDs can also be used to produce GBTDs with the following recursive construction.\nProposition 4.2 (FGBTD Construction): Suppose \t an FGBTD(3, g 1 g 2 · · · g s ) and a special GBTD 1 (3, g i + 1) for i ∈ [s] exist. Then a special GBTD 1 (3, s i=1 g i + 1) exists.\nCorollary 4.2: If an FGBTD(3, (3g) t ) and a special GBTD 1 (3, g + 1) exist, a special GBTD 1 (3, gt + 1) exists.\nFor Proposition 4.2 and Corollary 4.2 to be useful, we require large classes of FGBTDs. We give two recursive constructions for FGBTDs next.\nProposition 4.3 (Inﬂation): Suppose an FGBTD(3, T ) and a DRTD(3, n) exist. Then an FGBTD(3, nT ) exists.\nWilson\u2019s Fundamental Construction for GDDs [34] can be modiﬁed to admit the following specialization.\nWe construct some small GBTDs and FGBTDs that are required to seed the recursive constructions given in the previous section. This section summarizes the results.\nProposition 5.1: There exists a 2-∗colorable special GBTD 1 (3, q) for all prime powers q ≡ 1 mod 6.\nProposition 5.2: There exist a special GBTD 1 (3, m) for m ∈ {1, 9, 11, 17, 23, 29, 35, 47, 53, 55}, a 3-∗colorable GBTD 1 (3, m) with property Π for m ∈ {9, 11, 23} and a 3-∗colorable RBIBD(15, 3, 1) with property Π.\nProposition 5.3: There exist an FGBTD(3, 6 t ) for all t ∈ {5, 6, 7, 8}, an FGBTD(3, 24 t ) for all t ∈ {5, 8} and an FGBTD(3, 30 t ) for all t ∈ {5, 7}.\nIn this section, we apply recursive constructions in Section IV with small designs directly constructed in Section V to completely settle the existence of GBTDs.\nLemma 6.1: A special GBTD 1 (3, 3 r q) exists for all r ≥ 0 and q ∈ Q, where Q = {q : q ≡ 1 mod 6 is a prime power}∪ {5, 9, 11, 23}, except when (r, q) = (0, 5).\nProof: Existence of a special GBTD 1 (3, q) for all q ∈ Q \\ {5} is provided by Proposition 5.1 and Proposition 5.2. These GBTDs are all 3-∗colorable with property Π. The lemma follows by considering these GBTDs as RBIBDs and applying Corollary 4.1.\nLemma 6.2: Let s ∈ [2] and suppose there exists a TD(5 + s, n). If 0 ≤ g i ≤ n, i ∈ [s] and that there exists a special GBTD 1 (3, m) for all m ∈ {2n + 1} ∪ {2g i + 1 : i ∈ [s]}, then there exists a special GBTD 1 (3, 10n + 1 + 2 s i=1 g i ).\nProof: By Proposition 5.3, there exists an FGBTD(3, 6 t ) for all t ∈ {5, 6, 7}. By Proposition 4.4, there exists an FGBTD(3, (6n) 5 (6g 1 ) · · · (6g s )). Now apply Proposition 4.2 to obtain a special GBTD 1 (3, 10n + 1 + 2 s i=1 g i ).\nLemma 6.3: A special GBTD 1 (3, m) exists for odd m ≥ 7. Proof: First, a special GBTD 1 (3, m) can be constructed\nLet E = {t : t ≥ 9} \\ {10, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 46, 60}. Then a TD(7, n) exists for any n ∈ E (see [35]). If there exists a special GBTD 1 (3, m ) for odd m , 7 ≤ m ≤ 2n + 1, then apply Lemma 6.2 with 3 ≤ g 1 , g 2 ≤ n to obtain a special GBTD 1 (3, m) for odd m, 10n + 7 ≤ m ≤ 14n + 1.\nSuppose there exists a GBTD 1 (3, m ) for all odd m < m. Then there exists n ∈ E with 10n+7 ≤ m ≤ 14n+1. Suppose otherwise. Then there exists n 1 ∈ E such that 14n 1 + 1 < 10n 2 + 7 for all n 2 > n 1 and n 2 ∈ E. This, together with the fact that n 1 ≥ 9, implies that n 2 − n 1 > 3 for all n 2 ∈ E and n 2 > n 1 . However, a quick check on E gives a contradiction.\nSince n ∈ E and there exists a special GBTD 1 (3, m ) for all m ≤ 2n + 1 < 10n + 7 ≤ m (induction hypothesis), there exists a special GBTD 1 (3, m) and induction is complete.\nLemma 6.3 shows that a GBTD 1 (3, m) exists for all odd m = 3, 5. Main Theorem (iv) now follows.\nThis paper establishes the ﬁrst inﬁnite families of equitable symbol weight codes, whose code lengths are greater than alphabet size and whose relative narrowband noise error- correcting capabilities tend to a positive constant as length grows. Such codes have applications in dealing with narrow- band noise over a PLC channel. The construction method used is combinatorial and reveals interesting interplays with an extension of generalized balanced tournament designs, ﬁrst introduced by Lamken [29]. These have enabled us to borrow ideas from combinatorial design theory to construct symbol weight codes. In return, questions on equitable symbol weight codes offer new problems to combinatorial design theory. We expect this symbiosis to deepen.\nResearch of Y. M. Chee, H. M. Kiah, and C.
