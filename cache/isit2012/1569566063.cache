A node is said to incur a delay if its encoding of each transmitted symbol involves only its received symbols obtained before the time slot in which the transmitted symbol is sent (hence the transmitted symbol sent in a time slot cannot depend on the received symbol obtained in the same time slot). A node is said to incur no delay if its received symbol obtained in a time slot is available for encoding its transmitted symbol sent in the same time slot. In the generalized discrete memoryless network (DMN) [1], some nodes may incur no delay. We call the capacity region of the generalized DMN under the constraint that every node incurs a delay the positive-delay region. In this paper, we establish the cut-set outer bound on the positive-delay region.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the notation of this paper. Section III presents the formulation of the generalized DMN. Section IV proves the cut-set outer bound on the positive-delay region. Section V applies our cut-set outer bound in some two-node generalized DMN and show that the positive-delay region is strictly smaller than the capacity region. Section VI concludes this paper.\nWe use P r {E} to represent the probability of an event E. We use a capital letter X to denote a random variable with alphabet X , and use the small letter x to denote the realization of X. We use X n to denote a random column\nvector [X 1 X 2 . . . X n ] T , where the components X k have the same alphabet X . We let p X (x) denote the probability mass function of the discrete random variable X. We let p Y |X (y|x) denote the conditional probability P r {Y = y|X = x} for any discrete random variables X and Y . For simplicity, we drop the subscript of a notation if there is no ambiguity. For any N 2 -dimensional random tuple (W 1,1 , W 1,2 , . . . , W N,N ) ∈ W 1,1 × W 1,2 × . . . × W N,N and any set V ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , N } 2 , we let W V = (W i,j : (i, j) ∈ V ) be a subtuple of (W 1,1 , W 1,2 , . . . , W N,N ).\nWe follow the formulation of the generalized discrete memoryless network in [1]. We consider a general network that consists of N nodes. Let I = {1, 2, . . . , N } be the index set of the nodes. The N terminals exchange infor- mation in n time slots as follows. Node i chooses message W i,j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M i,j } and sends W i,j to node j for each (i, j) ∈ I ×I. We assume that each message W i,j is uniformly distributed over {1, 2, . . . , M i,j } and all the messages are independent. For each k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} and each i ∈ I, node i transmits X i,k ∈ X i and receives Y i,k ∈ Y i in the k th time slot where X i and Y i are some alphabets that depend on i. After n time slots, node i declares ˆ W j,i to be the transmitted W j,i based on W {i}×I and Y n i for each (i, j) ∈ I × I. To simplify notation, let M I×I denote the N 2 -dimensional tuple (M 1,1 , M 1,2 , . . . , M N,N ).\nDeﬁnition 1: An α-dimensional tuple (S 1 , S 2 , . . . , S α ), de- noted by S α , consisting of subsets of I is called an α-partition of I if ∪ α h =1 S h = I and S i ∩ S j = ∅ for all i = j.\nLet T ⊆ I be a set and S α be an α-partition of I. For any random tuple (X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X N ) ∈ X 1 × X 2 × . . . × X N , we let X T = (X i : i ∈ T ) be a subtuple of (X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X N ). In addition, we let X S h denote (X S 1 , X S 2 , . . . , X S h ) and let x S h be the realization of X S h for each h ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α}. Similarly, for any k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} and any random tuple (X 1,k , X 2,k , . . . , X N,k ) ∈ X 1 × X 2 × . . . × X N , we let X T,k =\n(X i,k : i ∈ T ) be a subtuple of (X 1,k , X 2,k , . . . , X N,k ). In ad- dition, we let X S h ,k denote (X S 1 ,k , X S 2 ,k , . . . , X S h ,k ) and let x S h ,k be the realization of X S h ,k for each h ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α}.\nDeﬁnition 2: A delay proﬁle is an N -dimensional tuple (b 1 , b 2 , . . . , b N ) where b i ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . .} for each i ∈ I. For two delay proﬁles B and B \u2032 , if every element of B is greater than or equal to B \u2032 , we write B B \u2032 . A delay proﬁle B is said to be positive if B (1, 1, . . . , 1).\nDeﬁnition 3: The discrete network consists of N ﬁnite in- put sets X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X N , N ﬁnite output sets Y 1 , Y 2 , . . . , Y N and α channels characterized by conditional distribu- tions p 1 (y G 1 |x S 1 ), p 2 (y G 2 |x S 2 , y G 1 ), . . . , p α (y G α |x S α , y G α−1 ), where S α and G α are two α-dimensional partitions of I. We call S α and G α the input partition and the output partition of the network respectively. The discrete network is denoted by (X I , Y I , S α , G α , p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p α ).\nWe deﬁne codes that use the network n times in the following two deﬁnitions.\nDeﬁnition 4: Let (X I , Y I , S α , G α , p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p α ) be a dis- crete network. For each i ∈ I, let h i and m i be the two unique integers such that i ∈ S h i and i ∈ G m i . Then, a delay proﬁle (b 1 , b 2 , . . . , b N ) is said to be feasible for the network if the following holds for each i ∈ I: If b i = 0, then h i > m i .\nDeﬁnition 5: Let B = (b 1 , b 2 , . . . , b N ) be a delay proﬁle feasible for (X I , Y I , S α , G α , p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p α ). A (B, n, M I×I )-code for n uses of the network consists of the following:\n1) A message set W i,j = {1, 2, . . . , M i,j } at node i for each (i, j) ∈ I × I.\n2) An encoding function f i,k : W {i}×I × Y k −b i i \t → X i for each i ∈ I and each k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}, where f i,k is the encoding function at node i in the k th time slot such\n3) A decoding function g i,j : W {j}×I × Y n j → W i,j for each (i, j) ∈ I × I, where g i,j is the decoding function for W i,j at node j such that g i,j (W {j}×I , Y n j ) = ˆ W i,j .\nGiven a (B, n, M I×I )-code, it follows from Deﬁnition 5 that for each i ∈ I, node i incurs a delay if b i > 0, where b i is the amount of delay incurred by node i. If b i = 0, node i incurs no delay, i.e., for each k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}, node i needs to receive Y i,k before encoding X i,k . The feasibility condition of B in Deﬁnition 4 ensures that the operations of any (B, n, M I×I )-code are well-deﬁned for the subsequently deﬁned discrete memoryless network; the associated coding scheme is described after the network is deﬁned.\nDeﬁnition 6: A discrete network (X I , Y I , S α , G α , p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p α ), when used multiple times, is called a discrete memoryless network (DMN) if the following holds for any (B, n, M I×I )-code. Let U k −1 = (W I×I , X k −1 I , Y k −1 I ) be\nthe collection of random variables that are generated before the k th time slot. Then, for each k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} and each h ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α},\nFollowing the notation in Deﬁnition 6, consider any (B, n, M I×I )-code on the DMN. In the k th time slot, X I,k and Y I,k are generated in the order\nby transmitting on the channels in this order p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p α using the (B, n, M I×I )-code (as prescribed in Deﬁnition 5). Speciﬁcally, X S h ,k , Y G h−1 ,k and channel p h together deﬁne Y G h ,k for each h ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α}. It is shown in [1] that the encoding of X S h ,k before the transmission on p h and the generation of Y G h ,k after the transmission on p h for each h ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α} are well-deﬁned.\nDeﬁnition 7: For a (B, n, M I×I )-code on the DMN, the average probability of decoding error of W i,j is deﬁned as P n i,j = P r{g i,j (W {j}×I , Y n j ) = W i,j } for each (i, j) ∈ I ×I.\nIn this paper, we focus on the capacity region for codes with positive delay proﬁles. The following deﬁnitions pertain to this notion.\nDeﬁnition 8: A rate tuple (R 1,1 , R 1,2 , . . . , R N,N ), denoted by R I×I , is B-achievable for the DMN if there exists a sequence of (B, n, M I×I )-codes with lim\nDeﬁnition 9: The B-capacity region, denoted by R B , of the DMN is the closure of the set of all B-achievable rate tuple R I×I with R i,i = 0 for all i ∈ I. We call\nProposition 1: Let B be a delay proﬁle feasible for the DMN. For any delay proﬁle B \u2032 for the DMN such that B \u2032 B, B \u2032 is feasible for the DMN and R B \u2032 ⊆ R B .\nProof: Since B is feasible for the DMN, it follows from Deﬁnitions 2 and 4 that B \u2032 is feasible for the DMN. Since any (B \u2032 , n, M I×I )-code on the DMN is also a (B, n, M I×I )-code if B \u2032 B by Deﬁnitions 2 and 5, the proposition then follows from Deﬁnition 9.\nIn the next section, we will prove the cut-set outer bound on the positive-delay region R + . To facilitate discussion, we let 1 denote (1, 1, . . . , 1). Since R + = R 1 by Proposition 1, it sufﬁces to prove the cut-set outer bound on R 1 .\nLemma 2: Let (X I , Y I , S α , G α , p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p α ) be a DMN. Fix any (1, n, M I×I )-code on the network. Then, for each k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} and each h ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α},\nProof: Let U k −1 = (W I×I , X k −1 I , Y k −1 I ) be the col- lection of random variables that are generated before the k th time slot for the (1, n, M I×I )-code. Consider the following chain of inequalities for each k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} and each h ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α}:\n(a) follows from Deﬁnition 5 that for the (1, n, M I×I ) code, X I,k is a function of U k −1 .\nConsequently, I (U k −1 , X S h ,k ; Y G h−1 ,k |X S h−1 ,k ) = 0, which implies that (3) is a Markov Chain.\nProposition 3: Let (X I , Y I , S α , G α , p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p α ) be a DMN. For any (1, n, M I×I )-code on the network, if some u, x I and y I satisfy\nP r {U k −1 = u, X I,k = x I } > 0 \t (4) and\nthen there exists some h ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α} such that p h (y G h |x S h , y G h−1 ) = 0 (where x S h is a component of x I , and y G h and y G h−1 are components of y I ).\nProof: Since S α and G α are α-partitions of I, P r {U k −1 = u, X I,k = x I , Y I,k = y I }\nfor all h ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α}. We now prove by induction on h that\nfor each h ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α}. For h = 1, the LHS of (8) is P r {U k −1 = u, X S 1 ,k = x S 1 ,Y G 1 ,k = y G 1 }\n> 0 \t (9) where\n(a) follows from Deﬁnition 6. (b) follows from (4) and (7).\nP r {U k −1 = u, X S m ,k = x S m ,Y G m ,k = y G m } > 0, (10) then for m + 1 ≤ α,\n> 0, \t (11) where\nSince (8) holds for h = 1 by (9), and (8) is true for h = m+ 1 if (8) is assumed to be true for h = m by (10) and (11) where 1 ≤ m ≤ α − 1, it follows by mathematical induction that (8) holds for h = 1, 2, . . . , α. Since (8) hold for h = α, it follows that\nLemma 4: For any (1, n, M I×I )-code, a DMN speciﬁed by (X I , Y I , S α , G α , p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p α ) is equivalent to a DMN speciﬁed by (X I , Y I , I, I, p 1 p 2 . . . p α ).\nProof: It sufﬁces to show that for any (1, n, M I×I )-code, (1) in Deﬁnition 6 is equivalent to\nfor each k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}. Fix a (1, n, M I×I )-code and a k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}. Let U k −1 = (W I×I , X k −1 I , Y k −1 I ) be the\ncollection of random variables that are generated before the k th time slot.\nWe ﬁrst show that (1) implies (12). Suppose (1) holds for each h ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α}. Consider the following three mutually exclusive cases:\nFor this case, the LHS of (12) equals zero. By Propo- sition 3, there exists some h ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α} such that p h (y G h |x S h , y G h−1 ) = 0, which implies that the RHS of (12) equals zero.\nCase P r {U k−1 = u, X I,k = x I , Y I,k = y I } > 0: For this case,\n= p U k−1 ,X I,k (u, x I )p Y I,k |U k−1 ,X I,k (y I |u, x I ) = p U k−1 ,X I,k (u, x I )\n(a) follows from follows from Deﬁnition 5 that for the (1, n, M I×I )-code, X I,k is a function of U k −1 .\nCombining the three mutually exclusive cases, we obtain that (1) implies (12).\nWe now show that (12) implies (1). Suppose (12) holds. Then for each h ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α} and each m ∈ {1, 2, . . . , h},\nP r {U k −1 = u, X S h ,k = x S h , Y G m ,k = y G m } =\nThen, for each h ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α}, the equality in (1) can be veriﬁed by substituting (13) into the LHS and the RHS.\nWe will invoke the following theorem to prove in Theorem 2 the cut-set outer bound on R 1 .\nTheorem 1 ( [1]): Let (X I , Y I , S γ , G γ , p ∗ 1 , p ∗ 2 , . . . , p ∗ γ ) be a DMN. Then for each achievable rate tuple R I×I , there exists a joint distribution for (X I , Y I ) satisfying\nTheorem 2: Let (X I , Y I , S α , G α , p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p α ) be a DMN. Then for each 1-achievable rate tuple R I×I , there exists a joint distribution for (X I , Y I ) satisfying\nProof: Since (X I , Y I , S α , G α , p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p α ) is equiva- lent to (X I , Y I , I, I, p 1 p 2 . . . p α ) for each (1, n, M I×I )-code by Lemma 4, (14) and (15) follow from applying Theorem 1 with γ = 1, S 1 = G 1 = I and p ∗ 1 = p 1 p 2 . . . p α .\nFor a generalized DMN, the positive-delay region can be strictly smaller than the capacity region. This has been demonstrated by El Gamal et al. [2] for a three-node relay network. In this section, we demonstrate the same for a two- node network. Consider a two-node DMN (X 1 , X 2 , Y 1 , Y 2 , ({1}, {2}), ({2}, {1}), p 1 , p 2 ) where all the alphabets are bi- nary,\nNote that p 1 (y 2 |x 1 ) is the conditional probability distribution for the binary symmetric channel (BSC). To facilitate dis- cussion, we call this network the BSC with correlated feed- back . For any ((1, 0), n, M {1,2}×{1,2} )-code on this network, X {1,2},k and Y {1,2},k are generated in the k th time slot in the\norder X 1,k , Y 2,k , X 2,k , Y 1,k for each k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}. Note that node 2 incurs no delay, and can use Y 2,k for encoding X 2,k because Y 2,k is generated before the generation of X 2,k .\nLet R denote the capacity region of the BSC with correlated feedback. It is shown in [1] that\nwhere H (ǫ) is the entropy of a Bernoulli random variable X with P r {X = 0} = ǫ. In the rest of this section, we will show\n  \nR 1,2 ≤ I(X 1 ; Y 2 |X 2 ), R 2,1 ≤ I(X 2 ; Y 1 |X 1 )\nwhere p (x 1 , x 2 , y 1 , y 2 ) = p(x 1 , x 2 )p 1 (y 2 |x 1 ) p 2 (y 1 |x 1 , x 2 , y 2 ) for some p(x 1 , x 2 ).\n  \n(19) It then follows from Theorem 2 that\nThe following proposition is reproduced from Proposition 2.5 in [3] to facilitate discussion.\nand Z, X → Y → Z forms a Markov Chain if and only if there exist two functions χ (x, y) and ϕ(y, z) such that p (x,y,z) = χ(x,y)ϕ(y,z) for all x, y and z whenever p(y) > 0. For any (X 1 , X 2 , Y 1 , Y 2 ) distributed according to\np (x 1 , x 2 , y 1 , y 2 ) = p(x 1 , x 2 )p 1 (y 2 |x 1 )p 2 (y 1 |x 1 , x 2 , y 2 ), (21) since the marginal distribution p (x 1 , x 2 , y 2 ) satisﬁes\nI (X 2 ; Y 1 |X 1 ) = H(Y 1 |X 1 ) − H(Y 1 |X 1 , X 2 ) ≤ 1 − H(Y 1 |X 1 , X 2 )\nwhere (a) follows from (17). It then follows from (19), (23), (24) and (22) that\nwhich implies from (18) that C (1,1) \t R for any 0 < ǫ < 1, which then implies from (20) that R (1,1) R for any 0 < ǫ < 1.\nWe establish the cut-set outer bound on the positive-delay region for the generalized DMN. In addition, for the BSC with correlated feedback, we show by applying our cut-set outer bound that the positive-delay region is strictly smaller than the capacity region.\nThe authors thank Gerhard Kramer for the useful discus- sion.
