Formally speaking, a permu- tation code (G, μ) is the orbit {Xμ | X ∈ G}, where G is a set of permutation matrices 1 and μ is a Euclidean vector. The main goal of permutation code is, \u201cfor a given Euclidean vector λ, to ﬁnd an orbit Xμ which minimizes a distance ||λ − Xμ|| over X ∈ G by an efﬁcient algorithm.\u201d\nIn recent years, study of permutation codes has been one of the most exciting topics in coding theory. In 2008, Jiang et.al. discovered a remarkable application of permutation code for ﬂash memory coding [2]. In 2010, Barg investigated per- mutation codes and their error-correction for rank modulation [3]. Papandreou et.al., reported implementation of permutation codes as drift-tolerant multilevel phase-change memory [4].\nWadayama discovered a new approach for error-correction of permutation codes by using a linear programing (LP) method [5]. The following problem is considered \u201cmaximize λ T Xμ, for ﬁxed Euclidean vectors μ, λ where X is taken over the Birkhoff polytope 2 .\u201d It is shown that if a matrix X 0 maximizes the problem above, then X 0 minimizes the Euclidean distance ||λ − Xμ|| where X is again taken over the polytope. The set of vertices of the Birkhoff polytope is\nequal to the set of permutation matrices. It implies that we can apply techniques of LP for decoding if G is the set of permutation matrices. For generalizing this approach, it would be meaningful to ﬁnd a method that yields linear constraints with no fractional points, called ML-certiﬁcate constraints.\nIn this paper, we present a novel technique to construct lin- ear constraints that have no fractional vertices by introducing a structure called \u201cconsolidation\u201d. This technique allows us to focus the discussions on code size, encoding algorithms and decoding algorithms to local structures. Furthermore, we show an application of this technique to ﬁnd a new compact graph.\nAs is mentioned in introduction, we deﬁne a permutation code (G, μ) from a set G of permutation matrices and a vector μ. Our argument in this paper will not rely on a choice of μ. Thus we focus the explanation on which G is obtained by our construction.\nThroughout this paper X i,j denotes the (i, j)th entry of a matrix X. The index of matrices and vectors will start with not 1 but 0; for example, (v 0 , v 1 , v 2 ). The set of real numbers will be denoted by R and the set of n-by-n matrices over R shall be denoted by M n ( R).\nAs our contribution, we obtain permutation codes that are decodable by using an LP method, have no fractional vertex, and are constructed from techniques of this paper.\nWe embed the permutation group S R on {0, 1, . . . , R − 1} into the set M R ( R) of matrices by the following manner: for a permutation σ in S R , we deﬁne an R-by-R matrix X σ by X σ i,j := δ j =σ(i) , where δ is the Kronecker delta.\nFor ν-by-ν matrices g 0 , g 1 , . . . , g R −1 and σ ∈ S R , we deﬁne a (νR)-by-(νR) permutation matrix X := (X ij ) as\nfor 0 ≤ i, j ≤ R − 1. X shall be denoted by (σ |g 0 , g 1 , . . . , g R −1 ). Let G be a set of ν-by-ν matrices and S a subset of S R . When we choose g r in the same group G,\nthe collection of matrices (σ |g 0 , g 1 , . . . , g R −1 ) is said to be a wreath product of G and S and is denoted by G S, where σ ∈ S. For example, a wreath product G S 3 consists of ⎛\n⎝ g 0 0 0 0 g 1 0 0 0 g 2\n⎝ g 0 0 0 0 0 g 1 0 g 2 0\n⎝ 0 g 0 0 g 1 0 0 0 0 g 2\n⎠ , ⎛\n⎝ 0 g 0 0 0 0 g 1 g 2 0 0\n⎝ 0 0 g 0 g 1 0 0 0 g 2 0\n⎝ 0 0 g 0 0 g 1 0 g 2 0 0\nLet C n denote a cyclic group of order n, D 2n a dihedral group of order 2n, and S n a symmetric group of order n!. We consider the groups C n , D 2n and S n are sets of permutation matrices of size n-by-n.\nLet ν and R be positive integers such that ν = 2, 4 and R ≥ 2. Deﬁne n := νR. For each 0 ≤ r ≤ R − 1, deﬁne G r as one of C ν , D 2ν , and S ν , and deﬁne G R as one of C R , D 2R , and S R . Then we can construct the following set G of νR-by-νR permutation matrices for a permutation code as G := {(g R |g 0 , g 1 , . . . , g R −1 ) | g r ∈ G r , 0 ≤ r ≤ R}.\nLet c, d and s denote the number of times C ν , D 2ν , and S ν that are chosen for G r (0 ≤ r ≤ R − 1) respectively. Similarly, deﬁne c R , d R and s R to be the number of C R , D 2R , and S R that are chosen for G R respectively. Hence only one of c R , d R , s R is 1 and the others are 0. By using this notation, the cardinality of G is ν c (2ν) d (ν!) s R c R (2R) d R (R!) s R .\nPreviously known examples [6], [7] are associated with the choices (c, d, s, c R , d R , s R ) = (0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1).\nNext let ν := 2 and n := 2R. For each 0 ≤ r ≤ R − 1, let us choose G r again from C 2 and the unit group, i.e., the group consists of only the identity matrix.\nLet c and u denote the number of times C 2 \u2019s and the unit groups that are chosen for G r (0 ≤ r ≤ R − 1) respectively. Similarly, deﬁne a set G and deﬁne c R , d R and s R . Hence only one of c R , d R , s R is 1 and the others are 0. By using this notation, the cardinality of G is 2 c R c R (2R) d R (R!) s R . For \u201cc = R and s R = 1\u201d, G becomes a group and is isomorphic to a signed permutation group \u201cas a group\u201d whose permutation code has been investigated in [1], [8].\nNext, let ν := 4 and n := 4R. Let P 4 denote the set of permutations, which are known as pure involutions in S 4 [5]. Then P 4 consists of three elements.\nFor each 0 ≤ r ≤ R − 1, let us choose G r again from C 4 , D 8 , S 4 and P 4 . Let c, d, s and p denote the number of times C 4 , D 8 , S 4 and P 4 that are chosen for G r (0 ≤ r ≤ R − 1) respectively. Similarly, deﬁne a set G and deﬁne c R , d R and s R . Hence only one of c R , d R , s R is 1 and the others are 0. By using this notation, the cardinality of G is 4 c 8 d 24 s 3 p R c R (2R) d R (R!) s R .\nA linear constraint l(X) for an n-by-n matrix is deﬁned as either a linear equation or a linear inequality on entries of\na matrix. Formally speaking, by regarding an entry X i,j as a variable (0 ≤ i, j < n), we state either\nfor some c 0 , c i,j ∈ R. If we need not clarify the variable X of a linear constant l(X), we denote it simply by l.\nNote III.1. Let us deﬁne three kinds of constraints: \u2022 (row-sum constraints) 0≤j<n X i 0 ,j = 1,\n\u2022 (column-sum constraints) 0≤i<n X i,j 0 = 1, \u2022 (positivity) X i 0 ,j 0 ≥ 0,\nfor any 0 ≤ i 0 , j 0 < n where X i,j is the (i, j)th entry of matrix X. L D denotes a set of linear constrains, deﬁned as\nLet L be a set of linear constraints. For a constant l ∈ L and a matrix X, if X satisﬁes l, we write X |= l. If X |= l for every l ∈ L, we write X |= L. A doubly stochastic constraint L for an n-by-n matrix is deﬁned as a set of linear constraints such that X |= L implies X |= L D . In particular, the constraints L D is a doubly stochastic constraint.\nThe collection of n-by-n matrices which satisfy all of linear constraints in a doubly stochastic constraint L is denoted by D n [ L]. We call D n [ L] a doubly stochastic polytope for L. Since X σ |= L D , we have S n ⊂ D n [ L D ]. Note that any doubly stochastic polytope is a subset of D n [ L D ]. For D ⊂ M n ( R), D is simply said to be a doubly stochastic polytope if there exists a doubly stochastic constraint L such that D = D n [ L].\nLet D be a doubly stochastic polytope. An element X ∈ D is called a vertex if there are neither elements X 0 , X 1 ∈ D with X 0 = X 1 nor positive numbers c 0 , c 1 such that X = c 0 X 0 + c 1 X 1 . We denote the set of vertices for D by Ver(D).\nA permutation code (G, μ) is called an LP (Linear Programming)-decodable permutation code if there exists L such that G = G L , where G L := Ver( D n [ L]) ∩ S n . The following is an error-correcting decoding algorithm for LP- decodable permutation codes.\nDeﬁnition III.2 (Error-Correcting Decoding Algorithm [5]). Input: vectors μ, λ, and a doubly stochastic constraint L. Output: a vector μ 0 .\nIt is important to remark that a solution is in Ver( D n [ L]) if the solution exists uniquely. Therefore we prefer a doubly stochastic constraint L such that Ver(D n [ L]) ⊂ S n for a permutation code (G L , μ).\nA doubly stochastic constraint L for an n-by-n matrix is called a compact constraint if\n\u2022 the doubly stochastic polytope D n [ L] is a bounded set, \u2022 the vertex set satisﬁes Ver( D n [ L]) ⊂ S n .\nBy the following theorem, the doubly stochastic constraint L D is compact.\nTheorem III.3 (Birkhoff von-Neuman Theorem). Ver( D[L D ]) = S n .\nOur primary interest is to ﬁnd a new class of compact constraints. To the best of the author\u2019s knowledge, not many compact constraints have been found yet.\nThe notion of compact graph has been introduced for the study of the graph isomorphism problem, a famous problem in computer science. Even though the motivation of the study of compact graphs seems far from error-correcting codes, we apply it to permutation codes.\nLet Γ := ( {0, 1, . . . , ν−1}, E) be a graph with its vertex set {0, 1, . . . ν−1} and its edge set E, i.e., E ⊂ {0, 1, . . . , ν−1} 2 . Note that, in this paper, Γ is allowed to be an undirected graph. Let A Γ be the adjacency matrix of Γ, i.e., A Γ ∈ M ν ( R) and its (i, j)-entry A Γ i,j is\nFor a graph Γ = (V, E) and its vertex v ∈ V , the cardinality # {i ∈ V | (i, v) ∈ E} (resp. #{j ∈ V | (v, j) ∈ E}) is called in-degree (resp. out-degree) of v. We call Γ a seed graph if Γ is connected and the in-degree of v is equal to the out-degree of v for any vertex v of Γ.\nFor a graph Γ = ( {0, 1, . . . , ν − 1}, E) and a posi- tive integer R, we deﬁne a graph Γ (R) with a vertex set\n{0, 1, . . . , νR − 1} as a graph with an adjacency matrix A Γ (R) := (I R |A Γ , A Γ , . . . , A Γ ), where I R is the R-by-R identity matrix and A Γ is the adjacency matrix for Γ. We call Γ (R) a union of R-Γs. Since Γ (R) is not connected, it is not a seed graph for R ≥ 2.\nTheorem III.4. Let Γ be a seed graph and R a positive integer. A union Γ (R) is compact if and only if Γ is compact.\nProof is given in IV-B using a \u201cconsolidation\u201d technique. When Γ is \u201cun-directed and R = 2,\u201d Theorem III.4 is the same as Tinhofer\u2019s theorem [7].\nFor a permutation σ and a graph Γ, we deﬁne a graph σ(Γ) as a graph associated with an adjacency matrix X σ A Γ (X σ ) −1 , where X σ is the permutation matrix associated with σ and A Γ is the adjacency matrix of Γ. A permutation σ is called an au- tomorphism for Γ if σ(Γ) = Γ holds, i.e., X σ A Γ (X σ ) −1 = A Γ . Let Aut(Γ) denote the set of automorphisms for Γ. It is easy to verify that X ∈ Aut(Γ) ⇐⇒ XA Γ = A Γ X for a permutation matrix X. Therefore D n [ L Γ ] ⊃ Aut(Γ) holds. By this inclusion and Birkhoff von-Neumann theorem, we have Ver( D n [ L Γ ]) ⊃ Aut(Γ) for any graph Γ. Hence Ver( D n [ L Γ ]) = Aut(Γ) if and only if L Γ is compact.\nSchreck showed \u201ca compact regular graph with prime vertices must be a circulant graph\u201d in [9]. Hence, it is not easy to design various compact graphs. On the other hand, Tinhofer showed \u201cany connected tree and any cycle are com- pact graphs\u201d in [6] and \u201ca union of the same two connected un-directed graph is compact\u201d in [7].\nExample III.5 (Line and Televis 3 ). Let E := {(i, j) | i − j = ±1}. Since Γ := ({0, 1, . . . , ν−1}, E) is a tree, Γ is a compact seed graph. If ν = 2, we call the graph a televis. Aut(Γ) is isomorphic to a cyclic group C 2 .\nExample III.6 (Circle). Let E := {(i, j) | i − j = ±1 (mod ν) }. Then Γ := ({0, 1, . . . , ν − 1}, E) is a compact seed graph and Aut(Γ) is isomorphic to a dihedral group D 2ν 4 , and is known as a reﬂection group of type I ν [10].\nThe following examples \u201ccycle\u201d have not been considered as compact graphs but they are.\nExample III.7 (Cycle). Let Γ = ( {0, 1, . . . , ν − 1}, E) be a directed cyclic graph, i.e., E = {(0, 1), (1, 2), . . . , (ν − 2, ν − 1), (ν − 1, 0)}. Then Γ is a compact seed graph and Aut(Γ) is a cyclic group C ν .\nThe aim of this section is to introduce a new technique \u201cconsolidation\u201d to construct a compact constraint.\nLet l be a linear constraint for an n-by-n matrix. We call l homogeneous if the constant term of l is 0. Formally speaking,\n0, for some c i,j ∈ R. For examples, the \u201cpositivity\u201d is homogeneous but the \u201crow-sum constraint\u201d is not. The fol- lowing weak constraints are homogeneous too: we call the following n-linear constraints weak row-sum constraints:\n0≤j<n X i 0 ,j = 0≤j<n X 0,j , for any 0 ≤ i 0 < n. Weak column-sum constraints are similarly deﬁned.\nA set L of linear constraints is said to be a quasi- homogeneous constraint if L consists of homogeneous con- straints, row-sum constraints and column-sum constraints. For example, L D and any graph constraint are quasi- homogeneous.\nFor a quasi-homogeneous constraint L, we construct a ho- mogeneous constraint L by replacing all row-sum (resp. all column-sum) constraints in L with weak row-sum constraints (resp. column-sum). We call L a merged constraint for L.\nLet us divide a νR-by-νR matrix X into R 2 block ma- trices X [r 0 ,r 1 ] of size ν-by-ν via the relation: X [r 0 ,r 1 ] i,j \t = X r 0 ν +i,r 1 ν +j , for 0 ≤ i, j < ν and 0 ≤ r 0 , r 1 < R. For example, if ν = 3 and R = 2, we have\n⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝\n⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠\nLet H be a set of linear constraints for an R-by-R matrix. For h(H) ∈ H, we deﬁne a linear constraint h # (X) for a νR-by-νR matrix by replacing H r 0 ,r 1 with 0≤j<ν X [r 0 ,r 1 ] 0,j . For H, we deﬁne H # := {h # | h ∈ H} and call it a holding constraint of degree ν. For example: let H := {h 1 (H) : H 00 + H 01 = 1, h 2 (H) : H 00 + H 10 = 1, h 3 (H) : H 11 ≥ 0}.\nLet M [r 0 ,r 1 ] be a quasi-homogeneous constraint for a ν- by-ν matrix for 0 ≤ r 0 , r 1 < R. Let H be a set of linear constraints for an R-by-R matrix. For {M [r 0 ,r 1 ] } and H, we deﬁne a linear constraint M H for a νR-by-νR matrix as\nr 0 , r 1 < R } ∪ {h # | h ∈ H}, where X is a νR-by-νR matrix and X [r 0 ,r 1 ] is the (r 0 , r 1 )th block of X of size ν-by-ν. We call M H a consolidation for {M [r 0 ,r 1 ] } and H. One of\nour main contributions is the following. Please refer a proof to the full version paper [11].\nTheorem IV.1. Let M [r 0 ,r 1 ] be a quasi-homogeneous con- straint for a ν-by-ν matrix for 0 ≤ r 0 , r 1 < R. Let H be a doubly stochastic constraint for an R-by-R matrix.\nIf any M [r 0 ,r 1 ] and H are compact, we have the following: 1) Ver( D νR [ M H]) = {(σ|g 0 , . . . , g R −1 ) | σ ∈\nVer( D R [ H]), g r ∈ Ver(D ν [ M [r,σ(r)] ]) }. 2) the consolidation M H is compact.\nwhere v [r,σ(r)] denotes the cardinality of Ver( M [r,σ(r)] ). Lemma IV.2. Let Γ be a compact seed graph with ν-vertices and L D (R) a doubly stochastic constraint in Note III.1, for an R-by-R matrix. Let M Γ be a set {M [r 0 ,r 1 ] } of quasi- homogeneous constrains, where M [r 0 ,r 1 ] := L Γ .\nProof: By using the block component X [ij] , the equation XA Γ (R) = A Γ (R) X is equivalent to X [ij] A Γ = A Γ X [ij] , for\nall 0 ≤ i, j < R. Therefore L Γ (R) ⊂ M Γ L D (R) . It implies D[L Γ (R) ] ⊃ D[M Γ L D (R) ].\nLet us show that X ∈ D[M Γ L D (R) ] for any X ∈ D[L Γ (R) ]. Note that M Γ L D (R) \\ L Γ (R) consists of weak row-sum and weak column-sum constraints. We can verify that Γ is a seed graph and X ∈ D[L Γ (R) ] satisﬁes weak row-sum and weak column-sum constraints (see [11]), then X |= M Γ L D (R) , in other words, X ∈ D[M Γ L D (R) ].\nProof for Theorem III.4: \t By Lemma IV.2, Ver( D νR [ L Γ (R) ]) ⊂ S νR holds.\nExamples of compact quasi-homogeneous constraints in III-A and III-C except for trees, have (reasonably) small com- putational cost encoding algorithms for the matrix sizes. For L D in Note III.1 for an n-by-n matrix, an encoding algorithm with computational cost O(n log n) is known (Sec.5.1 of [12]). Our idea is to assume M [i,j] = M [i,0] and to reduce the dis- cussion to a local encoder Enc i : {0, 1, . . . , v i −1} → G M [i,0] , for 0 ≤ i, j < R and an encoder Enc R : {0, 1, . . . , v R − 1} → G H . A decoder is obtained in a similar manner.\nDeﬁnition V.1 (Encoding algorithm). Input: integer 0 ≤ mes < v 0 v 1 . . . v R and μ ∈ R νR . Output: a vector μ ∈ R νR .\nAn additional equation XA Γ = A Γ X may decrease the computational cost for error-correction. Here we present an example with a graph Γ of type televis (see Example III.5). Let us regard a linear constraint X [r 0 ,r 1 ] 0,0 − X [r 0 ,r 1 ] 1,1 = 0 as\nThen the number of variables are reduced from 4R 2 to 2R 2 . Furthermore, the linear constraint L Γ (R) is converted to a doubly stochastic matrix L Γ (R) :\nTotally, there are only 2R 2 + 2R linear constraints. Remember that L Γ (R) ⊃ L D (2R) . However, we have # L Γ (R) < # L D (2R) , since L D (2R) consists of 4R 2 + 4R constraints. In this case with a union of televis, an LP problem for error-correction is\nwhere λ is a received vector and μ is the initial vector of a permutation code.\nTheorem V.2. Let Γ be a graph and and P σ a permutation matrix associated with a permutation σ. Then we have\nD n [ L σ (Γ) ] = {P σ X(P σ ) −1 | X ∈ D n [ L Γ ] }, Ver( D n [ L σ (Γ) ]) = {P σ X(P σ ) −1 | X ∈ Ver(D n [ L Γ ]) }\nwhere L Γ is a graph constraint for Γ. Hence σ(Γ) is compact if and only if Γ is compact.\nLet G be a permutation group. The minimum Euclidean distance d E (G) motivated by the previous researches e.g., [5], is deﬁned as d E (G) := min g 0 ,g 1 ∈G,g 0 =g 1 ||g 0 μ − g 1 μ || 2 /2, where μ = (1, 2, . . . , n) ∈ R n . The minimum Kendall tau distance d K (G), motivated by rank modulation researches e.g., [3], is deﬁned as d K (G) := min g 0 ,g 1 ∈G,g 0 =g 1 # {(i, j) | 0 ≤ i < j < n, g 0 g −1 1 (i) > g 0 g −1 1 (j) }. In general, d K (G Γ ) = d K (G Γ (R) ) and d E (G Γ ) = d E (G Γ (R) ) hold. However, we may enlarge the distances.\nHere is an example. Let Γ be a televis and σ is a permutation on {0, 1, 2, 3} deﬁned as σ(0) := 0, σ(1) := 2, σ(2) := 1, and σ(3) := 3. By routine calculation, we can verify d K (G Γ (2) ) = 1 < d K (G σ (Γ (2) ) ) = 2, and d E (G Γ (2) ) = 1 < d E (G σ (Γ (2) ) ) = 2. Characterizing which permutation σ maximizes these distances is interesting but not easy. We leave this problem open to investigation."},"refs":[{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Permutation Modulation"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Rank Modulation for Flash
