Recent research of these codes has been focused on a subclass of these codes, known as QC low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which have advantages over other types of LDPC codes in hardware im- plementation of encoding and decoding [2]-[4]. Furthermore, well designed QC-LDPC codes can perform as well as any other types of LDPC codes. Most of LDPC codes adopted as standard codes for various next generations of communication and storage systems are QC-LDPC codes.\nA q-ary QC-LDPC code is given by the null space of an array H of sparse circulant matrices of the same size over a ﬁnite ﬁeld. If the array H, called the parity-check matrix, has constant column weight γ and constant row weight ρ, H and the code given by the null space of H are said to be ( γ,ρ)-regular, otherwise it is said to be irregular. Major methods for constructing QC-LDPC codes, i.e., the parity- check matrices consisting of sparse circulant matrices, can be divided into two general categories, graph-theoretic (GT) based and algebraic methods. To design codes, the ﬁrst step is determining their dimensions, i.e., ranks of their parity- check matrices. Generally the parity-check matrices of GT QC-LDPC codes are full-rank or almost full-rank. However, the parity-check matrices of some classes of regular algebraic QC-LDPC codes have low rank and are rich in redundant rows.\nIt is well-known that degree distributions and girth are two design criteria to optimize the performance of message-passing decoding algorithms for LDPC codes. Row-redundancy has been shown to have great impact on the performance of LDPC codes. Thus, it is a potential way to improve the performance of QC-LDPC codes. However, there is a lack of algorithms to construct redundant rows while keeping the size of girth.\nRecent development in QC-LDPC codes (QC codes in general) is the introduction of a matrix-theoretic approach\nfor studying these code based on matrix transformation via Fourier transforms [7], [9]. By matrix transformation, ranks of certain classes of algebraic QC-LDPC codes [7], [6] are given, but some constraints may have to be applied.\nIn this paper, we follow the Fourier transform approach presented in [7] to expand the analysis and construction of all QC-LDPC codes. Based on the properties of conjugacy classes and Hadamard products of matrices, general analysis includes the rank and row-redundancy of an array of circulants whose null space gives a QC-LDPC code. Tight and general upper and lower bounds on the rank and row-redundancy of an array of circulants are derived. For some known QC- LDPC codes, the equalities of these bounds hold. Thanks to the general lower bound on row-redundancy, it is possible for us to construct redundant rows in code design, which make it possible to further improve the performance of QC- LDPC codes from row-redundancy way. Moreover, a new construction of algebraic QC-LDPC codes, which is based on random partitions of ﬁnite ﬁelds, are also given. These codes not only have ﬂexible choices on code dimensions, but also are rich in redundant rows.\nThe organization of the rest of this paper is as follows: First, we present the characterization of QC codes in the Fourier transform domain in Section II. Then, we analyze ranks and row-redundancy of QC-LDPC codes in terms of transform domain in Section III. Later, we show that row-redundancy can increase the performance of QC-LDPC codes. In Section IV, we construct a class of QC-LDPC codes based on random partitions of ﬁnite ﬁelds. Moreover, all the simulations are over AWGN channels with BPSK transmission. The paper is summarized in the last section.\nIn this section, we give a review of characterization of QC codes in the Fourier transform domain presented in [7]. Some new interpretations and extensions are given.\nConsider a ﬁnite ﬁeld GF( q) of q = 2 r elements. Let α be an element of GF( q) with order e and a be an e-tuple over GF(2), where e is a factor of q − 1. Due to the limited space, we consider only the case e = q −1 in this paper. The proof of other cases are similar. The Fourier transform of the e-tuple a [7], [9] denoted by F[a], is given by the e-tuple b over GF( q) whose t-th component, b t , for 0 ≤ t < e, is given by b t = a 0 +a 1 α t +a 2 α 2t +· · ·+a e− 1 α (e−1)t . The vector a, which\nis called the inverse Fourier transform of the vector b, denoted by a = F − 1 [b], can be retrieved using the following equation, for 0 ≤ l < e: a l = b 0 + b 1 α − l + b 2 α − 2l + · · · + b e− 1 α − (e−1)l .\nLet A = [a ij ], 0 ≤ i, j < e, be an e × e circulant over GF(2), i.e., if every row is a cyclic-shift (one place to right) of the row above it, including end-around. Then, we write A = circ(a), where a is its top row, called the generator of A. Deﬁne two e × e matrices over GF(q) as follows: V = [α − ij ] and V − 1 = [α ij ], 0 ≤ i, j < e. Both matrices, V and V − 1 , known as Vandermonde matrices [9], are non-singular. Moreover, V − 1 is the inverse of V and vice versa. Taking the matrix product VAV − 1 , we obtain the following e × e diagonal matrix over GF( q),\nA F = VAV − 1 = diag(b 0 , b 1 , ..., b e− 1 ), \t (1) where the diagonal vector (b 0 , b 1 , ..., b e− 1 ) is the Fourier transform of the generator a of the circulant of A. The diagonal matrix A F = VAV − 1 is referred to as the Fourier transform of the circulant A. Since a is an e-tuple over GF(2), the components must satisfy the following constraint [7]:\nfor 0 ≤ t < e, where (2t) e denotes the nonnegative integer less than e and congruent to 2t modulo e. This condition is known as the conjugacy constraint.\nLet m and n be two positive integers. Let H = [A i,j ] 0 ≤ i < m, 0 ≤ j < n be an m × n array of e × e circulants A i,j over GF(2), where a i,j is the generator of the circulant A i,j . Next, we deﬁne Ω(m) as an m × m diagonal array of V\u2019s and Ω − 1 (n) as an n × n diagonal array of V − 1 \u2019s,\nThen the Fourier transform of H is given as, H F = Ω(m)HΩ − 1 (n) = [A F i,j ], where A F i,j = VA i,j V − 1 , is an e × e diagonal matrix with diagonal vector (b i,j, 0 , b i,j, 1 , ..., b i,j,e− 1 ) which is the Fourier transform of the generator a i,j of A i,j .\nDeﬁne the following index sequences: for 0 ≤ i, j < e, π row,i = [i, e+i, ..., (m−1)e+i], and π col,j = [j, e+j, ..., (n− 1)e + j]. Let π row = [π row, 0 , π row, 1 , ..., π row,e− 1 ], and π col = [π col, 0 , π col, 1 , ..., π col,e− 1 ]. Then π row gives a permutation of the indices of the rows of H F and π col gives a permutation of the indices of columns of H F . By these permutations, H F results in the following e × e diagonal array of m × n matrices over GF( q),\nH F ,π = diag(B 0 , B 1 , ..., B e− 1 ). \t (5) The transformation from H to H F ,π through H F is reversible. Moreover, it preserves the rank of the matrices [7], [9]. Let rank(M) denote the rank of a matrix M over a ﬁnite ﬁeld.\nThe m × n matrices B i \u2019s on the diagonal of the array H F ,π satisfy the conjugacy constraint. In a latter section, we will develop a tight lower bound for computing the rank of H based on the conjugacy constraint on matrices B t \u2019s. To specify this constraint, we introduce the concept of Hadamard product.\nLet B = [b i,j ] and C = [c i,j ] be two matrices of the same size. The Hadamard product of B and C [9], denoted by B ◦C, is deﬁned as their element-wise product, i.e., B ◦C = [b i,j c i,j ]. The Hadamard product of t copies of the matrix B, where t is a nonnegative integer, denoted by B ◦ t , is B ◦ t = [b t i,j ] which is referred to as the t-th Hadamard power of B. We allow t to equal 0 and in this case b 0 i,j = 1 if b i,j is a nonzero element in GF( q) and b 0 i,j = 0 if b i,j = 0.\nFor an array H of circulants and zero matrices (ZM) over GF(2), the matrices on the main diagonal of the array H F ,π satisfy the conjugacy constraint [7],\ni.e., the entry at the location (i, j) of B (2t) e is the square of the entry at the location (i, j) of B t . We call the matrix B (2t) e a conjugate matrix of B t .\nA circulant matrix whose generator has single 1-component is called circulant permutation matrix (CPM). In most con- struction of parity-check matrices of QC-LDPC codes, each circulant in H is either a CPM or a ZM. In this case, the conjugacy constraint become\nB t = B ◦ t 1 \t (8) and we can use B to denote B 1 such that the construction of H can be carried out directly from the transform domain B = [b i,j ] (called base matrix) as follows: For each entry b i,j in B, 1) if b i,j = 0, let b i,j = α l with 0 ≤ l < e, replace b i,j by an e×e CPM whose generator has a single 1-component at position l, 2) if b i,j = 0, replace b i,j by an e×e ZM. The above construction of the RC-constrained array H directly from the base matrix B is referred to as e-fold dispersion of B.\nIf the base matrix B satisﬁes the following 2 × 2 submatrix (SM)-constraint speciﬁed by the following theorem, then the parity-check matrix H of the QC-LDPC code satisﬁes the RC- constraint and its Tanner graph has a girth at least 6. A proof can be found in [7]. Such a base matrix B is called a 2 × 2 SM-constrained base matrix.\nTheorem 1. A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for an array H of CPM\u2019s and/or ZM\u2019s to satisfy the RC-constraint is that every 2 × 2 submatrix in the base matrix B contains at least one zero entry or is non-singular.\nIn this section, we give a general analysis of the rank and row-redundancy of the parity-check matrix of a binary QC- LDPC code in the Fourier transform domain. In [8], we will\nshow that it is amicable for existing codes, e.g., Latin square codes, multiplicative group codes and additive group codes, not only binary, but also nonbinary.\nThe row-redundancy of a matrix is deﬁned as the ratio of the number of redundant rows (or dependent rows) of the matrix to the total number of rows of the matrix. It is well-known that row-redundancy speeds up the rate of decoding convergence [10]. We will show later that it also improves the performance.\nIf H is an array of circulants and ZM\u2019s over GF(2), based on the conjugacy constraint speciﬁed by (7), it can be readily proved by induction that for any integers t > 0,\nFrom (9) we can group the e matrices B 0 , B 1 , ..., B e− 1 into conjugacy classes. Let λ be the number of distinct conjugacy classes and Ψ 0 , Ψ 1 , ..., Ψ λ− 1 denote these classes, where Ψ 0 contains only the matrix B 0 and Ψ 1 contains B 1 and its conjugate matrices. For 0 ≤ i < λ, let c i be the number of matrices in the conjugacy class Ψ i , where c i is the smallest nonnegative integer such that (2 c i t) e = t. Suppose B t i is member matrix in Ψ i , then it follows from (9) that\nThe subscripts of the conjugate matrices in Ψ i actually form the cyclotomic coset Z i = {t i , 2t i , ..., 2 c i − 1 t i } modulo e. It is clear that for i = 0, we have t i = 0 and c i = 1. The matrix in Ψ i with the smallest power is called the representative of the conjugacy class Ψ i . From the following theorem, we know that matrices in the same conjugacy class have the same rank.\nTheorem 2. Let B be an m × n matrix over GF(q). For any nonnegative integer t ≤ r, the matrix B ◦ 2 t (the 2 t -th Hadamard power of B) has the same rank as B.\nFor 0 ≤ i < λ, let µ i be rank of the matrices in the conjugacy class Ψ i . Then it follows from (6) that the rank of the parity-check matrix H is given by\nIf we know c 0 , c 1 , ..., c λ− 1 and µ 0 , µ 1 , ..., µ λ− 1 , then we can compute the rank of H from (10). This can be done by ﬁrst partitioning the set {B 0 , B 1 , B 2 , ..., B (e−1) } into λ conjugacy classes Ψ 0 , Ψ 1 , ..., Ψ λ− 1 and determining the rank of the conjugate matrices in each class. Then, use (10) to compute the rank of H. This can be carried out systematically. (The procedure is omitted. Please refer to [8] for details).\nIf H is an m × n array of CPM\u2019s and ZM\u2019s of size e × e, an upper bound on the rank of H can be derived which is amicable to the analyses of rank and redundancy. First, we need the following theorem which was proved in [8].\nTheorem 3. Let M 1 and M 2 be two m × n matrices over GF( q) with rank(M 1 ) and rank(M 2 ), respectively, and M 1 ◦ M 2 be the Hadamard product of M 1 and M 2 . Then the\nrank of M 1 ◦ M 2 , denoted by rank(M 1 ◦ M 2 ), satisﬁes the following inequality:\nConsider the class Ψ i = {B ◦ t i , B ◦ 2t i , ..., B ◦ 2 ci−1 t i } of conjugate matrices. It follows from our construction of the cyclotomic cosets that t i is the smallest integer in Z i . Hence, B ◦ t i is the representative matrix of the conjugacy class Ψ i . Then t i − 1 must be contained in the i ∗ th cyclotomic coset Z i ∗ with i ∗ < i. Thus, B ◦ (t i − 1) is a member matrix in the conjugacy class Ψ i ∗ with representative B ◦ t i∗ where t i ∗ is the representative in the cyclotomic coset Z i ∗ . Since i ∗ < i and t i ∗ ≤ t i − 1, then we must have t i ∗ < t i . Since the rank of the matrices in conjugacy class Ψ i ∗ is µ i ∗ , then rank(B ◦ (t i − 1) ) = µ i ∗ . It follows from\nFrom (10) and (13), we obtain an upper bound on the rank of the parity-check matrix H which is given by the next theorem.\nTheorem 4. Let H be an m × n array of CPM\u2019s and ZM\u2019s over GF(2) of size e × e given by the e-fold dispersion of an m × n matrix B over GF(q) with q = 2 r and e = 2 r − 1. Let µ 0 and µ 1 be the ranks of B 0 = B ◦ 0 and B, respectively. Then, the following gives an upper bound on the rank of H,\nIn [8], we provide details to construct cyclotomic cosets systematically by a table.\nNext we derive a straightforward upper bound on rank(H) which only depends on the size and the ranks of B 0 and B. Consider the t-th Hadamard power B ◦ t of the base matrix B for 0 < t < e. Let τ (t) denote the number of 1\u2019s in the binary representation of t and f 0 , f 1 ..., f τ (t)−1 denote the position of these 1\u2019s. Then\nThe number τ (t) is called the weight of the integer t. Since 0 < t < e = 2 r − 1, we have 1 ≤ τ (t) < r. Using the above binary representation of t, the t-th Hadamard power B ◦ t of the base matrix B can be expressed as the following Hadamard product of B ◦ 2 f0 , B ◦ 2 f1 , ..., B ◦ 2 fτ(t)−1 :\nSince each term in the product of (16) is a conjugate matrix of the base matrix B, they are all in the same conjugacy class with B as the representative and hence they have the same rank µ 1 as B. It follows from Theorem 3 and (16) that the\nSince for 0 < i ≤ r − 1, there are r i nonzero integers less than e with weight i. Then based on (6) and (17) we derive the following theorem that gives an upper bound on the rank of an array of CPM\u2019s and/or ZM\u2019s of size e × e.\nTheorem 5. Let H be an m × n array of CPM\u2019s and ZM\u2019s over GF(2) of size e × e given by the e-fold dispersion of an m × n matrix over GF(q) with q = 2 r and e = 2 r − 1. Let µ 0 and µ 1 be the ranks of B 0 = B ◦ 0 and B, respectively. Then, the rank of H is upper bounded as follows:\nThe upper bound given by (18) depends only on the choice of the base matrix B. For most of 2 × 2 SM-constrained base matrices, this bound is very tight. If the base matrix B has special structures, a combinatorial expression for rank(H) can be derived, which will be shown in [8].\nDeﬁnition 1. Let H be an m × n matrix over GF(2). Let rank(H) denote the rank of H. The row-redundancy of H is deﬁned as the ratio ξ = (m − rank(H))/m. If H has full rank, i.e., rank(H) = m, then its row-redundancy is zero.\nIt follows from the above deﬁnition that m − rank(H) is simply the number of redundant rows of H, denoted by R(H). Using the upper bound on the rank of the parity-check matrix H given by (18), we obtain the following lower bound on\nQC-LDPC codes with large R(H) have been reported in [10], [11], which are all constructed by array dispersions of 2 × 2 SM-constrained base matrices using ﬁnite ﬁelds. They are arrays of CPM\u2019s and/or ZM\u2019s. Here we would like to show the impact of row-redundancy by an simple example of the (255, 175) EG-LDPC code given in [10]. From Fig. 1, it is clear that the performance of the SPA decoding algorithm[13]\nof the EG-LDPC code improves as the row-redundancy of H increases. The performance of H with all row-redundancy 0.6863 is about 0.6 dB better than the performance of H with no row-redundancy 0 at bit error rate (BER) 10 − 5 .\nIn this section, we present a new algebraic method for constructing a class of QC-LDPC codes. Given a ﬁnite ﬁeld, we ﬁrst partition the elements of the ﬁeld into two disjoint subsets (any partition). Based on these two disjoint subsets, we form a matrix over the given ﬁeld. Every entry of the matrix is a sum of two elements, one from one subset and the other from the second subset. From this matrix, we can form a matrix consisting of CPM\u2019s and ZM\u2019s, which satisﬁes the RC-constraint. Then, its null space gives a QC-LDPC code.\nRecall that α is a primitive element of GF(q). Let m and n be two positive integers such that m + n ≤ 2 r . Partition these m + n elements of GF(q) into two disjoint subsets, G 1 = {λ 0 , λ 1 , ..., λ m− 1 } and G 2 = {δ 0 , δ 1 , ..., δ n− 1 }, i.e., G 1 ∩ G 2 = φ. Form the following m × n matrix over GF(q):\nB rp = [λ i + δ j ] , \t (20) where 0 ≤ i < m and 0 ≤ j < n. We note that each row of B rp is formed by adding an element in G 1 to all the n elements in G 2 and each column of B rp is formed by adding an element in G 2 to all the m elements in G 1 . Since the characteristic of the ﬁeld GF( q) is 2, every element in GF(q) is its own additive inverse. From the fact that G 1 and G 2 are disjoint and the formation of B rp , we readily prove that: 1) all the entries in B rp are nonzero; 2) all the entries in a row of B rp are different; and 3) all the entries in a column of B rp are different. Every entry in B rp is a power of the primitive element α of GF(q). In the following, we prove that the m × n matrix B rp over GF (q) given by (20) satisﬁes the 2 × 2 SM-constraint.\nTheorem 6. The m × n matrix B rp over GF (q) given by (19) satisﬁes the 2 × 2 SM-constraint.\nSince the base matrix B rp over GF (q) satisﬁes the 2 × 2 SM-constraint. It can be used to construct an m × n RC- constrained binary array H rp of CPM\u2019s and ZM\u2019s. Since each entry in B rp is a nonzero element in GF (q), it must be a power of α which is a primitive element of GF(q). Then the construction of H rp is directly from the e-fold dispersion of B rp . Since all the entries are nonzero, H rp contains no ZM.\nH rp is an me×ne matrix over GF(2). Since each CPM has both column and row weights equal to 1, the column and row weights of H rp are m and n respectively. Consequently, the null space of H rp gives an RC-constrained QC-LDPC code of length ne with minimum distance at least m + 1 whose Tanner graph has a girth at least 6. Clearly, there are many combinations of m and n such that it is ﬂexible to design codes with various length and dimension. Moreover, the null space of any sub-array of H rp also gives a QC-LDPC code.\nNext we will analyze the rank to show that the resulting parity-check matrix is rich in redundant rows. First, because there are no zero elements in B rp , B 0 is an all \u20181\u2019 matrix and has rank µ 0 = 1. Second, we will show that the rank of B rp is small µ 1 = min{m, n, 2} in [8]. From Theorem 5, an upper bound on rank(H rp ) can be given from the base matrix B rp ,\nIn [8], we will prove that for parity-check matrices constructed based on random partitions, the equality holds in most cases. Also, we will show that Theorem 5 is tight and the equality holds for many classes of QC-LDPC codes in [8].\nExample 1. Let GF (2 6 ) be the ﬁeld for construction. Let α be a primitive element of GF (2 6 ). Partition GF(2 6 ) into two sub- sets, G 1 = {0, 1, α, α 2 , α 3 , α 4 } and G 2 = {α 5 , α 6 , ..., α 62 }. Using these two subsets, we can construct a 6 × 58 base matrix B rp over GF (2 6 ). Array dispersion of this base matrix results in a 6 × 58 array H rp of 63 × 63 CPM\u2019s. H rp is a 378 × 3654 RC-constrained matrix over GF(2) with column and row weights 6 and 58, respectively. We ﬁnd that the rank of H rp is 319, which is exactly bounded by (21). Hence, the null space of H rp gives a (6,58)-regular (3654,3335) QC-LDPC code with rate 0.9126. The bit and block error performances of the code decoded with 5, 10 and 50 iterations of the MSA [13] are shown in Fig. 2. We see that the decoding of the code converge fast. At the BER 10 − 6 , the code decoded with 50 iterations of the MSA perform 1.2 dB from the Shannon limit. At the BLER ( block error rate) 10 − 5 , it performs 0.8 dB from the sphere packing bound.\nThanks to the rank analyses [5]-[6] based on the Fourier transform, we could expand the rank analysis and row- redundancy into all QC-LDPC codes. It is possible to take row-redundancy into account in code constructions such that structured QC-LDPC codes can achieve better performance. Furthermore, we presented a class of 2 × 2 SM-constrained base matrices which are constructed based on partitions of ﬁnite ﬁelds of characteristic of 2. QC-LDPC codes deﬁned by the null space of these base matrices are ﬂexible for\ncode design. For these codes, the equalities of the above bounds hold. Due to the space limits, we have to omit several proofs and the nonbinary case. Please refer to [8] for details. Furthermore,in [8], we construct a (4, 8) LDPC code deﬁned by the null space of a 120 × 240 parity-check matrix with 10 redudant rows, whose performance of the SPA decoding algorithm [13] is 0.2 dB better than two γ = 4 PEG codes [12] at BER 10 − 5 , as shown in Fig. 3."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R.
