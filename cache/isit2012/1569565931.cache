To meet this challenge, current systems usually apply cryptographic techniques to keep information secret. These techniques are based on the assumption of insufﬁcient computational capabilities of non-legitimate receivers, but due to increasing computational power, recent advances in number theory, and improved algorithms, these techniques are becoming more and more insecure.\nInformation theoretic, or physical layer, security solely uses the physical properties of the wireless channel to establish a higher level of security. Thus, whatever transformation is applied to the signals at the eavesdroppers, the original mes- sage cannot be reproduced with high probability. Information theoretic security was initiated by Wyner, who introduced the wiretap channel [1], and later generalized by Csisz´ar and K¨orner to the broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages [2]. Recently, there is growing interest in information theoretic security; for instance see [3, 4] and references therein.\nHowever, usually the criterion of weak secrecy is applied, which is heuristic in nature in that no operational meaning has been given to it yet. This means that even if this criterion holds, it is not clear what an eavesdropper can or cannot do to decode the conﬁdential message. But recently, an operational meaning has been given to the strong secrecy criterion introduced by Maurer and Wolf [5]: it was established in [6, 7] for the wiretap channel that the strong secrecy criterion implies that the average decoding error at the eavesdropper tends to one for any decoder it may use.\nAnother challenge for operators of wireless networks is the provision of sufﬁcient channel state information at transmitter and receivers. In practical systems there is always uncertainty in channel state information due to the nature of the wireless medium. A reasonable model is to assume that the exact channel realization is not known; rather, it is only known that it belongs to a pre-speciﬁed set of channels. If this channel remains ﬁxed during the whole transmission of a codeword, this corresponds to the concept of compound channels [8, 9].\nTo date, there is only little work that incorporates both tasks: information theoretic security in interaction with channel un- certainty. The compound wiretap channel is analyzed in [6, 7, 10]. The MIMO compound wiretap channel is studied in [11] and the MIMO compound broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages in [12].\nIn this paper we consider the compound broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages where the sender transmits not only a conﬁdential message to a legitimate receiver with strong secrecy, but also an additional common message to both, the legitimate and non-legitimate receiver. Thus, it is related to [2] and extends it in two ways: ﬁrst, it takes channel uncertainty into account and, second, it employs the strong secrecy criterion. 1\nLet X , Y, and Z be ﬁnite input and output sets and S = {1, ..., S} be an index set. Then for ﬁxed s ∈ S and input and output sequences x n ∈ X n , y n ∈ Y n , and z n ∈ Z n , the discrete memoryless broadcast channel is given by W ⊗n s (y n , z n |x n ) := n i=1 W s (y i , z i |x i ). We denote its marginal channels by W ⊗n Y,s (y n |x n ) and W ⊗n Z,s (z n |x n ).\nDeﬁnition 1: The discrete memoryless compound broad- cast channel W is given by W := {(W Y,s , W Z,s ) : s ∈ S}.\nWe consider the standard model with a block code of arbitrary but ﬁxed length n. Let M 0 := {1, ..., M 0,n } and M 1 := {1, ..., M 1,n } be the sets of common and conﬁdential messages. Further we use the abbreviation M := M 0 × M 1 .\nDeﬁnition 2: An (n, M 0,n , M 1,n )-code for the compound broadcast channel W with conﬁdential messages consists of a stochastic encoder\nThe average probability of errors at the receivers 1 and 2 are then given by\nTo ensure that the conﬁdential message is kept secret from non-legitimate receiver 2 for all s ∈ S, we require max s∈S I(M 1 ; Z n s ) ≤ n for some (small) n > 0 with M 1 the random variable uniformly distributed over the conﬁdential message set M 1 and Z n = (Z 1 , Z 2 , ..., Z n ) the output at receiver 2. This criterion is known as strong secrecy [5].\nDeﬁnition 3: A rate pair (R 0 , R 1 ) ∈ R 2 + is said to be achievable for the compound broadcast channel with conﬁ- dential messages if for any δ > 0 there is an n(δ) ∈ N and a sequence of (n, M 0,n , M 1,n )-codes such that for all n ≥ n(δ) we have 1 n log M 0,n ≥ R 0 − δ, 1 n log M 1,n ≥ R 1 − δ, and\nwhile ¯ e 1,n , ¯ e 2,n , n → 0 as n → ∞. The closure of the set of all achievable rate pairs is the strong secrecy capacity region of the compound broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages.\nTheorem 1: An achievable strong secrecy rate region for the compound broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages is given by the set of all rate pairs (R 0 , R 1 ) ∈ R 2 + that satisfy\nRemark 1: Since receiver 2 is a legitimate receiver for the common message and at the same time a non-legitimate receiver for the conﬁdential message, we have made different assumptions on its channel. Accordingly, we have to assume the worst channel in (3a) for the common message and the best channel in (3b) for the conﬁdential message.\nIn this paper we extend Devetak\u2019s approach [13] introduced for the wiretap channel to the compound broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages. This approach establishes strong secrecy using only the noisy channel. We start with a basic observation concerning the relationship of total variation dis- tance and mutual information.\nLemma 1: Let A and B be ﬁnite sets and let A and B be corresponding random variables. If P A ⊗P B −P AB ≤ ≤ 1 2 , then\nThus, for I(M 1 ; Z n s ) to be small, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd for every > 0 a code that satisﬁes\ntriangle inequality follows that it is sufﬁcient to ﬁnd for every s ∈ S and every (m 0 , m 1 ) ∈ M 0 × M 1 a measure ϑ s,m 0 on Z n such that\nHere we prove Theorem 1, i.e., the achievability of (3) with strong secrecy. Therefore, we construct a codebook that enables reliable communication of all messages, while ensuring the secrecy of the conﬁdential message. Additionally to the key observation in (4), we need two ingredients.\nThe ﬁrst one ensures reliable communication of the common message m 0 to both receivers and of the conﬁdential message m 1 to receiver 1. Let us drop the security requirement on m 1 for a moment, i.e., m 1 need not be be kept secret from non- legitimate receiver 2. Then this scenario corresponds to the broadcast channel with degraded message sets [15].\nLemma 2: An achievable rate region for the compound broadcast channel with degraded message sets is given by all rate pairs (R 0 , R 1 ) ∈ R 2 + that satisfy\nfor random variables U−X−(Y s , Z s ) with average probability of errors ¯ e 1,n , ¯ e 2,n ≤ 2 −nγ for some γ > 0.\nSketch of Proof: The region can be proved using random coding arguments. More precisely, a superposition of code- words for the common message and for the private message according to the chosen input distributions (6) and (7) will allow to prove the result in a similar way as for example in [16] for the compound bidirectional broadcast channel. The details are omitted due to lack of space.\nRemark 2: For |S| = 1 the region (5) reduces to a subregion of [15]. More precisely, the sum constraint on receiver 1 of the form R 0 + R 1 ≤ I(X; Y s ) in [15] is replaced by individual constraints on R 0 ≤ I(U; Y s ) and R 1 ≤ I(X; Y s |U) which makes the region smaller. However, (5) will be sufﬁcient to establish the desired result in (3).\nThe second ingredient will be used to incorporate the strong secrecy requirement on m 1 . In more detail, we will exploit the concentration of sums of i.i.d. random variables around their expectation as given in the following lemma which is due to Chernoff and Hoeffding [17].\nLemma 3: Let b > 0 and Z 1 , Z 2 , ..., Z L be i.i.d. random variables with values in [0, b]. Further, let µ = E[Z 1 ] be the expectation of Z 1 . Then\n1 L\nAfter these preliminary considerations we come to the coding part. For probability distribution P U ∈ P(U ) and δ > 0, let T n U,δ be the set of δ-typical sequences on U n , cf. for example [14]. We deﬁne\nThis allows us to deﬁne the random coding scheme as follows. Let M 0 be the set of common messages where its size M 0,n is determined by (5a), cf. Lemma 2. Let M 1 be the set of conﬁdential messages and further L := {1, ..., L n } with M 1,n and L n to be determined later. Let {U n m\n: m 0 ∈ M 0 } be i.i.d. random variables with values in U n according to P U n , cf. (6). Then for each m 0 ∈ M 0 we deﬁne random variables\n: (l, m 1 ) ∈ L × M 1 } with values in X n , which are i.i.d. conditional on U n m 0 according to P X n |U n , cf. (7).\nNow we come to the application of Lemma 3. We note that the channel W Z,s can also be regarded as a channel with inputs in U × X where the U -inputs do not make any difference. Moreover, it will be sufﬁcient to concentrate only on those outputs that are typical; the probability of all other outputs will be of no consequence as we will see later. Therefore, we deﬁne for every channel s ∈ S, message triple (l, m 1 , m 0 ), and z n ∈ Z n the random variable\nwhere for any set A ⊂ Z n , we let 1 A (z n ) = 1 if z n ∈ A and 1 A (z n ) = 0 else. Conditional on U n m 0 , these random variables are i.i.d. Moreover, as the input (X n lm\n, U n m 0 ) is jointly δ-typical with respect to the joint distribution P XU , and the outputs of Q n s are δ-typical conditional on the inputs, it is well known that (8) is bounded from above by\nbe the expectation of (8) conditional on U n m 0 . For any n > 0 we deﬁne\n(z n ) and \t similarly \t Q n s,U n\n(z n ). Then we deﬁne the event Q(z n ) as\n(11) Now let z n ∈ Z n . Then for the complement of Q(z n ) we get\n(z n ) 2 ln 2\n2 ln 2 \t (12) where the steps follow from the law of total probability, from Lemma 3 and (9), and from (10) and\nfor some δ 2 = δ 2 (δ), see e.g. [14], since U n m 0 is δ-typical. Note that if we choose n = 2 −nβ for some β ≤ 1 4 min{γ, δ 1 + δ 2 }, then (12) tends to zero doubly-exponentially for\nThis provides the basis for the proof of (4). Note that we have to choose the maximum in (13) to ensure that (12) tends to zero doubly-exponentially for all channel realizations s ∈ S.\nNext, we determine the sizes of the remaining sets for the conﬁdential message. For max s ∈S I(X; Z s |U) < I(X; Y s |U) for all s ∈ S, we choose δ (and therewith also δ 1 and δ 2 ) small enough such that (13) is satisﬁed and at the same time\nFrom (12)-(13) we know that (11) is satisﬁed for every s ∈ S, (m 0 , m 1 ), and z n ∈ Z n with probability close to one. Further, with M 0,n , M 1,n , L n as deﬁned above it follows from Lemma 2 that the random codewords we have chosen are the codewords of a deterministic code achieving ¯ e 1,n , ¯ e 2,n ≤ 2 −nγ for some γ > 0 with probability close to one. Thus, there must be realizations of (U n m 0 , X n lm\n) and ϑ s,U n m0 with both these properties, which we denote by (u n m 0 , x n lm 1 m 0 ) and ϑ s,m 0 .\nFrom this we construct an appropriate code with a stochastic encoder. Therefore, each message pair (m 0 , m 1 ) ∈ M 0 × M 1 is mapped into the codeword x n lm 1 m 0 ∈ X n with probability 1/L n which deﬁnes a stochastic encoder. The decoder at legitimate receiver 1 decodes all indices, i.e., (l, m 1 , m 0 ), while the decoder at non-legitimate receiver 2 only decodes the common message m 0 . From Lemma 2 we know that this code is suitable for reliable transmission of all messages to their respective receivers. It remains to prove that (4) is satisﬁed.\nFrom the triangle inequality we obtain for every s ∈ S and (m 0 , m 1 ) ∈ M 0 × M 1\nIn the following we bound all three parts individually which we denote by I, II, and III. Since all codewords satisfy (11), we have for the third term III ≤ .\nfor some constant c > 0, where we again interpret W Z,s as a channel from U × X to Z and use the fact that the probability that the output of a channel is not δ-typical conditional on the inputs is exponentially small, cf. for example [14].\nwhich is at most 1 − (1 − )ϑ s,m 0 (F s,m 0 ) by (11). Note that if z n is δ-typical conditional on (x n lm\n, u n m 0 ), then it is 2|X |δ-typical conditional on u n m 0 , so that ϑ s,m 0 (z n ) = 0 only for z n ∈ T n Z\n(u n m 0 ). With the deﬁnition of F s,m 0 , this implies\nby the same argument as for term I. Thus, in total we can bound the second term from above as\nPutting all three terms together, we can bound the total variation distance as\nwhich proves (4). Note that (14) becomes exponentially small since we chose n = 2 −nβ . Thus, the mutual information between the conﬁdential message M 1 and the corresponding output Z n s at the non-legitimate receiver is exponentially small for every s ∈ S, cf. Section III.\nThis proves the achievability of the desired rate region but only for random variables U − X − (Y s , Z s ). To obtain the whole region given in (3), note that the transmitter can preﬁx an artiﬁcial channel P X|V : V → P(X ) with ﬁnite V to\nW s = (W Y,s , W Z,s ). Then the whole construction above can similarly be done for the channel\nRemark 3: Note that the effect of the preﬁx channel can be integrated in the stochastic encoder, cf. Deﬁnition 2.\nHere we consider the converse of Theorem 1, where we establish a multi-letter characterization of an outer bound on the strong secrecy capacity region. For this we need the following lemma.\nLemma 4: Let W := {(W Y,s , W Z,s ) : s ∈ S} be an arbitrary compound broadcast channel. Then\nexists and equals sup n∈N 1 n (inf s∈S I(V; Y n s |U) − sup s∈S I(V; Z n s |U)) for random variables U − V − X n − (Y n s , Z n s ).\nProof: We follow [7] and use Fekete\u2019s lemma [18] to prove the desired result. We have to show that the sequence (a n ) n∈N with\nwhich follows from the independence of the two Markov chains. Since these Markov chains can be arbitrary, we con- clude a n+m ≥ a n + a m for all n, m ∈ N.\nTheorem 2: An outer bound on the strong secrecy capacity region of the compound broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages is given by all rate pairs (R 0 , R 1 ) ∈ R 2 + that satisfy\nProof: For any given sequence of (n, M 0,n , M 1,n )-codes of Deﬁnition 2 with ¯ e 1,n , ¯ e 2,n → 0 and\nwith c,n → 0, there exist U − V − X n − (Y n s , Z n s ) such that all rate tuples (R 0 , R 1 ) ∈ R 2 + are bounded by (15).\nLet M 0 and M 1 be random variables uniformly distributed over the message sets M 0 and M 1 . We have the Markov chains (M 0 , M 1 ) − X n − Y n s − ( ˆ M 0,1 , ˆ M 1 ) and (M 0 , M 1 ) − X n − Z n s − ˆ M 0,2 where the ﬁrst transition is governed by the stochastic encoder E, cf. (1), the second by the channels W ⊗n Y,s , W ⊗n Z,s , and last one by the corresponding decoder, cf. (2). Then we have for all s ∈ S at receiver 1 for the common rate\nwhere the last inequality follows from Fano\u2019s inequality, i.e., H(M 0 |Y n s ) ≤ H(M 0 , M 1 |Y n s ) ≤ n 1,n , and similarly for all s ∈ S at receiver 2\nNext, we follow [2] and make use of the deﬁnition of mutual information. Rewriting (16) we get for the conﬁdential rate\nwith 12,n = 1,n + 2,n where the ﬁrst inequality fol- lows from I(M 1 ; M 0 |Z n s ) = H(M 0 |Z n s ) − H(M 0 |Z n s , M 1 ) ≤ H(M 0 |Z n s ) ≤ 2,n and the second inequality from H(M 1 |Y n s , M 0 ) ≤ H(M 1 , M 0 |Y n s ) ≤ 1,n .\nWith I(M 1 ; Y n s |M 0 ) \t = \t I(M 0 , M 1 ; Y n s |M 0 ) and I(M 1 ; Z n s |M 0 ) = I(M 0 , M 1 ; Z n s |M 0 ), (17)-(19) imply that the rates are bounded by\nRecall that the transition between the messages (M 0 , M 1 ) and the input X n is governed by a stochastic encoder, which allows us to introduce arbitrary auxiliary random variables U and V which satisfy the Markov chain U − V − X n − (Y n s , Z n s ), cf. also Remark 3. Dividing by n and taking the limit yields\nwhere Lemma 4 guarantees that the quantities exist and are well deﬁned. This concludes the proof.\nRemark 4: Applying the achievability result given in Theo- rem 1 to the channels W ⊗n Y,s and W ⊗n Z,s yields the achievability result for the corresponding multi-letter case. Together with the converse result given in Theorem 2 we conclude on the following.\nCorollary 1: A multi-letter description of the strong secrecy capacity region of the compound broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages is given by all rate pairs (R 0 , R 1 ) ∈ R 2 + that satisfy\nIn this paper we derived an achievable strong secrecy rate region for the compound broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages.
