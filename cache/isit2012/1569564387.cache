An instance to the problem consists of an undirected graph G = ( V, E ) representing a communication network (in which each node of G represents a client, and edges in G represent client pairs that can communicate with each other), a parameter k representing the number of information packets X = { x 1 , . . . , x k } to be transmitted over the network, and a set { X i } i ∈V of subsets of X representing the set of packets available at each client node v i ∈ V in the initial stage of the transition. The objective is to design a communication scheme in which, eventually, all nodes of the network will obtain all k packets. Loosely speaking, in each round of the communication scheme, a single node broadcasts a single (possibly encoded) packet to all its neighbors in G. The goal is to ﬁnd a communication scheme in which the number of communication rounds is minimum.\nThe coded cooperative data exchange problem has seen signiﬁcant research over the last few years. The problem was introduced by El Rouayheb et al. in [16], where data exchange over a complete graph G was considered (in which each client can broadcast its messages to all other clients in G). In [16] certain upper and lower bounds on the optimal number of transmissions needed was established. In a subsequent work, Sprinston et al. [18] continue the study of complete graphs G and present a (randomized) algorithm that with high probability achieves the minimum number of transmissions, given that the packets are elements in a ﬁeld F q with q large enough. Ozgul et al. [14] study a variant of the data exchange problem in which each client has a distinct broadcast cost and one wishes to minimize the cost of the transmission scheme after which all clients have obtained all information packets. In [14], optimal randomized linear encoding schemes are given for the problem at hand.\nCommunication in which fractional packets can be trans- mitted is addressed in the works of Courtade et al. in [3] (for general topologies G) and Tajbakhsh et al. [19], [20] (for the complete topology). In the fractional setting, packets are assumed to be divisible into chunks so that a fraction of a packet may be transmitted at any (fractional) round of communication; as opposed to the integral setting in which information packets are indivisible. In [3], [19], [20] it is shown that the fractional setting of the data exchange problem reduces to that of multicast network coding and can be efﬁciently solved in an optimal manner via linear programming and the concept of linear network coding, see e.g. [1], [7], [8], [10], [11].\nMost related to our work is the work of Courtade et al. in [4] which focus on general topologies G in the setting of indivis- ible packets (the integral setting). [4] continue the paradigm of [3] which characterizes the data exchange problem as a family of cut inequalities, and present certain communication schemes that yield approximate solutions for an asymptotic number of packets k. Roughly speaking, [4] analyze a certain communication scheme in which each client transmits at a certain ﬁxed rate over time, and obtain nearly optimal rate allocations (within an additive approximation of εk for general graphs, and | V | for regular graphs). An important aspect in the analysis in [4] is the assumption that the number of packets k tends to inﬁnity. A detailed comparison of the results of [4] with ours appears below at the end of Section I-A.\nMost recently, Milosavljevic et al. [13] present a compre- hensive study of data exchange over the complete topology in which one wishes to broadcast the components of a (jointly distributed) discrete memoryless multiple source. Efﬁcient optimal rate schemes are presented for a number of side information models.\nIn this work we study the coded cooperative data exchange problem on general topologies. We focus on the combina- torial integral setting in which one assumes that packets are indivisible. Namely, we assume that each packet is a value from a given alphabet Σ, and in each communication round a single element of Σ is broadcasted by a client to its neighbors in G. The study of the indivisible integral setting, rises naturally in communication schemes in which dividing information packets to several chunks leads to undesirable overhead in communication (via scheduling issues or rate loss due to header information). Our work addresses the design and analysis of efﬁcient algorithms that (approximately) solve the problem at hand. Throughout our work, we assume that the number of packets k is polynomial in the size of the network | V | . In this context, an efﬁcient algorithm is one which is polynomial in the network size.\nWe start by tying the data exchange problem in general topologies G to certain well studied combinatorial properties of G. Speciﬁcally, we consider the Dominating Set problem (e.g., [9]) and its variants (to be deﬁned in Section II), and show that they are closely related to the data exchange prob- lem. Namely, we show that (i) a solution to the Dominating Set problem (or its variants) yields a (not necessarily optimal) solution to the data exchange problem, and (ii) an optimal solution to the data exchange problem yields a nearly optimal solution to the Dominating Set problem(s). Roughly speaking, these connections (together with others) imply two initial results. Primarily, that it is NP-Hard to ﬁnd a solution to the data exchange problem in which the number of communication rounds is within a multiplicative factor of Ω ( log | V |) from the optimal. Secondly, that a conceptually simple data exchange algorithm, that does not involve encoding, based on the Dominating Set problem yields a number of communication rounds which is within a multiplicative factor of O ( k · log | V |) from the optimal.\nThe gap between the upper and lower bounds above is k (the number of distinct packets in the network) which may be of signiﬁcant size. Reducing this gap is the main focus of our work. Roughly speaking, in this work we reduce the gap of k by analyzing our algorithm based on the Dominating Set problem(s). Our algorithm does not involve coding and in such yields bounds on the coding advantage in the setting of data exchange. Our detailed results are given below, which at times are the best possible (assuming standard tractability assumptions).\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we present the model and notation used throughout this work, including the several variants of the Dominating Set problem used\nin our analysis. In Section III, we prove that it is NP- Hard to approximate the data exchange problem on general topologies within a multiplicative factor of Ω ( log n ) (for any k polynomial in n). Here, n = | V | .\nIn Section IV, we present our algorithm for data exchange based on the Dominating Set problem and its variants. The algorithm we present is conceptually very simple and does not involve coding. As mentioned above, a naive analysis of our algorithm yields an approximation ratio of O ( k · log n ) , and the majority of this section is devoted to proving that the algorithm actually performs better.\nIn Section IV-B, we show that our algorithm is the best possible (assuming standard tractability) and has an approx- imation ratio of O ( log n ) (matching the lower bound of Section III) on instances in which each packet is initially present at a single client in G. This implies a coding advantage of O ( log n ) in such cases. 1\nIn Section IV-C, we study data exchange instances in which the underlying graph is regular (each client has the same number of neighbors). We show that the approximation ratio in this case is again better than O ( k · log | V |) and depends on the average number ¯ d of packets available at client nodes. Specif- ically we show that in this case the approximation ratio of our algorithm is O\nlog n (thus improving the factor of k in the naive analysis to 1 + ¯ d k − ¯d ). Notice, that for ¯ d = Θ ( k ) (the case in which on average each client initially has a constant fraction of the packets) we obtain an approximation ratio that matches the bound of Section III. Our results imply a coding advantage of O\nlog n in the cases at hand. Finally, in Section IV-D we study general graphs G with no restrictions and present an improved approximation ratio to that naively mentioned above.\nWe conclude our work by studying a reﬁned version of our algorithm (still without encoding) in Section IV-E and by discussing future research directions in Section V. Due to space limitations, our claims appear without complete proofs (which can be found in the full version of this work [5]).\nComparing our results with those in [4] is not straightfor- ward. Courtade et al. [4] focus on the setting in which the number of packets k tends to inﬁnity and may be signiﬁcantly greater than the network size n. The setting of asymptotic k allows the design of algorithms which are efﬁcient with respect to k but may be exponential in n. In our work we focus on the setting in which k is polynomially bounded by n, and obtain communication schemes that can be designed efﬁciently in time polynomial in the network size n. In addition, [4] focus on the case in which every client initially holds a constant fraction of the k information packets; 2 and in this setting study additive approximations. In this work, we study multiplicative\napproximations, and our assumptions (if any) on the packet distribution are of different nature.\nWe start by deﬁning the Coded Cooperative Data Exchange Problem for General Graphs. Let G = ( V, E ) be a given undirected graph with V = { v 1 , ..., v n } . Let X = { x 1 , ..., x k } be a set of packets to be delivered to the n clients belonging to the set V. The packets are elements of a ﬁnite alphabet which will be assumed to be a ﬁnite ﬁeld F q . At the beginning, each client v i knows a subset of packets denoted by X i ⊆ X, while the clients collectively know all packets in X. We denote by\n¯ X i = X \\ X i the set of packets required by client v i . For each client (vertex in G) v i let d v i = | X i | be the number of packets it holds, let ¯ d = ∑ v ∈V d v /n be the average number of packets present at vertices of G, and let d = max v ∈V d v be the maximum number if packets that any client holds. We will use these parameters in our analysis.\nEach client may transmit packets to its neighbors in G via a lossless broadcast channel capable of transmitting a single element in F q . The data is transmitted in communication rounds, such that at round i one of the clients, say v, broadcasts an element x ∈ F q to all its neighbors in G. The transmitted information x may be one of the original packets in X j , or some encoding of packets in X j and the information previously transmitted to v j .\nOur goal is to devise a scheme that enables each client v i ∈ V to obtain all packets in ¯ X i (and thus in X) while minimizing the total number of broadcasts. This work focuses on the integral (i.e., scalar) setting in which each broadcast consists of a single element of F q . We denote by NC the minimum number of (integral) broadcasts needed to satisfy the given instance to the coded cooperative data exchange problem at hand. In this work we connect the value of NC with other well studies combinatorial operators on G deﬁed below.\nThroughout our work, we assume that the number of packets k is polynomial in the size of the network | V | (i.e., k ≤ | V | c for some constant c). In this context, we say an algorithm is efﬁcient if its running time is polynomial in the network size.\nGiven an undirected graph G = ( V, E ) , a dominating set, e.g. [9], of G is a subset of vertices S such that every v ∈ V is either in S or connected to some vertex s ∈ S by an edge ( s, v ) ∈ E. In such a case we say that v ∈ N ( s ) where N ( s ) = { v | ( s, v ) ∈ E } . In this work we also study the self dominating set problem which is closely related to the standard dominating set problem. In a self dominating set S, we require that every v ∈ V is connected to some vertex s ∈ S by an edge ( s, v ) ∈ E. The minimum size dominating set in G is denoted by DS and the minimum sized self dominating set by DS + . Clearly we have that DS ≤ DS + . A (self) dominating set S with a corresponding induced subgraph that is connected is referred to as a connected (self) dominating set. Denote by CDS (respectively CDS + ) the size of a minimum connected\ndominating set (respectively, self dominating set) in G. We will show below that computing (or approximating) any of the values mentioned above (i.e., DS, CDS, DS + , CDS + ) is NP-Hard.\nIn this work we will also be interested in a fractional version of the dominating and self dominating set problems expressed by the following linear programs. We present the linear program corresponding to the self dominating set problem. An analogous program can be designed for (standard) dominating sets. Given a graph G = ( V, E ) , ﬁnd a set of capacities C = { c v , | v ∈ V, 0 ≤ c v ≤ 1 } (where for each v ∈ V, c v is the capacity of vertex v) such that ∑ v ∈V c v is minimum, and ∀ v ∈ V it holds that ∑ u ∈N(v) c u ≥ 1.\nLet DS + f denote the minimum value of the linear program above (respectively DS f for standard dominating sets). By considering integral values of c v , it is straightforward to establish that DS + f ≤ DS + and DS f ≤ DS.\nAs we will see, there are times in which we would like to \u201ccover\u201d each vertex in G more than once by our dominating sets S. We thus consider the integer and fractional k (Self) Dominating Set problems as well. Below we phrase the fractional version, for k self dominating set with optimum denoted by ( k-DS + ) f , the integer variant is obtained by setting c v ∈ { 0, 1 } and its optimum will be denoted by k-DS + : ﬁnd a set of capacities C = { c v | v ∈ V, 0 ≤ c v ≤ 1 } such that ∑ v ∈V c v is minimum, and ∀ v ∈ V it holds that ∑ u ∈N(v) c u ≥ k. One can analogously deﬁne ( k-DS ) f corre- sponding to the standard dominating set problem.\nThe lemma below now follows by the above deﬁnitions (detailed proof appears in full version of this work [5]).\nThe following lemma that constructively connects between dominating sets and their connected variant was proven in [6].\nIt is NP-Hard to estimate the size of the minimum dom- inating set of a given graph G up to a multiplicative factor of Ω ( log | V |) [15]. Notice that if CDS > 1, then CDS + = CDS, (and in general CDS + ≤ CDS + 1) so ﬁnding CDS, and CDS + (and also approximating them beyond a ratio of Ω ( log | V |) ) is also NP-hard. Lemma 2 and the deﬁnition of the self dominating set problem imply the following lemma which connects DS, DS + , CDS, and CDS + :\nIn this section we show that the coded cooperative data ex- change problem is hard to approximate within a multiplicative factor of c log | V | , for some c > 0, for every value of k (which is polynomial in n). Our proof is based on a reduction from the dominating set problem (which, as mentioned, is NP-hard\nto estimate within a multiplicative factor of c log | V | , for some c > 0 [15]). Proof of our claims appear in [5].\nWe ﬁrst show our hardness for k = 1 even in the case that only one vertex holds all the information packets. (See Lemma 7 in the full version of the paper [5] for the proof). This implies that our upper bound for the case of disjoint sets of messages discussed in Section IV-B is tight. We then turn to the case of general k using an enhanced gap preserving reduction depicted in Figure 1. Namely, given an instance G = ( V, E ) to the dominating set problem, we construct the following graph G \u2032 = ( V \u2032 , E \u2032 ) for the coded cooperative data exchange problem. G \u2032 has k copies of G, and a new vertex v, such that v is connected to a vertex u i in each copy G i of G. All vertices u i know all messages, v knows no message, and for each G i all vertices in G i besides u i know all messages besides the i\u2019th one. We show the following lemma:\nIn this section we give an approximation algorithm for the coded data exchange problem and analyze its approximation ratio. In the ﬁrst subsection we present the approximation algorithm. In the second subsection we analyze the quality of the algorithm on a number of graph families or initial packet allocations, and show that for these instances the approximation ratio of the given algorithm matches (or comes close to matching) the results given in the previous section. In the third subsection we extend our analysis to the general case.\nThe following lemma introduces an approximation algo- rithm for the cooperative data exchange problem.\nThe idea behind the proof of Lemma 5 is conceptually simple. Roughly speaking, given a connected dominating set D, one can propagate each and every packet in D to all clients of G via a Breadth First Search (BSF) from the client holding the packet. Since the problem of ﬁnding a minimum connected dominating set is NP-hard, we need to show how to approximately ﬁnd such a set. Loosely speaking, we will ﬁnd a connected dominating set in our network G by ﬁrst solving the fractional dominating set problem, by then rounding the fractional solution to an integral one to obtain a standard dominating set of G, and by ﬁnally modifying the dominating set to a connected one via Lemma 2. All in all, this (well studied) scheme will efﬁciently yield a connected dominating set D of size at most c log n · DS f for some universal constant c > 0 (see e.g., [2], [9], [12], [17]).\nRepeating the above more formally, given an instance G to the cooperative data exchange problem on general topologies, one can efﬁciently perform the following algorithm:\n1) Solve the fractional dominating set problem on G to obtain a fractional solution { c f v } .\n2) Change the fractional solution to an integral one { c v } corresponding to a dominating set D (via, e.g., [2], [9], [12], [17]).\n3) Using D, construct a connected dominating set D \u2032 (Lemma 2) with | D \u2032 | = O ( | D |) .\n4) Broadcast the k messages according to the procedure implied by Lemma 5 in O ( k | D \u2032 |) ≤ O ( k log n · DS f ) communication rounds.\nThe procedure above will yield a communication scheme with at most O ( k log n · DS f ) communication rounds. To understand the quality of the algorithm, one must express the size NC (or at least bound it from below) by an expression which can be easily compared with the bound O ( k log n · DS f ) . For example, consider an instance to the data exchange problem in which d = max v ∈V d v < k (here, for all v i ∈ V d v i = | X i | ). We have seen via Lemma 1 that NC ≥ ( k − d ) · DS + f ≥ ( k − d ) · DS f ≥ DS f . Thus, on these instances we obtain a solution to the data exchange problem that is within a multiplicative factor of O ( k log n ) from the optimal solution. It is also not hard to see (we do this implicitly in Section IV-E) that even if d = max v ∈V d v = k a slight variant to our algorithm yields a solution which is within a multiplicative factor of O ( k log n ) from the optimal solution. The next sections attempt to improve this ratio to better match the hardness results presented in Section III. Speciﬁcally, we show that the factor of k in the ratio O ( k log n ) can be reduced or in cases removed.\nIn this subsection we analyze our approximation algorithm for the case that for each two nodes v, u it holds that X v ∩ X u = ∅. Note that this includes the case where only one node holds all the information, and all other nodes have no\ninformation. For this case we are able to improve over the lower bound presented in Lemma 1 and show (proof appears in full version [5]) that:\nLemma 6 NC ≥ k · DS f . Which implies that:\nIn this subsection we show that if the given graph is regular our approximation algorithm has a ( 1 + ¯ d/ ( k − ¯ d )) · O ( log n ) approximation ratio. As before, we start by giving a lower bound for NC in this case. Namely, let G be a ∆ regular graph, and let ¯ d = 1 n ∑ d v , then (proofs appear in full version [5]) we have that:\nIn this subsection we analyze the quality of our approxi- mation algorithm for any instance G. The full version of this work [5] presents an example that shows that our lower bound for regular graphs stated in Lemma 7 of ( k − ¯ d ) · DS f does not hold for general graphs. We use ∆ to denote the maximum degree of G and δ to denote the minimum degree of G. We generalize Lemma 7 to the case of general graphs:\nIn the full version of this work [5], we present a reﬁned version of our algorithm from Section IV-A. The algorithm we present will not yield improved asymptotic approximation ratios, however it yields improved communication schemes that at times may match those returned by the algorithm of Section IV-A and at times may be signiﬁcantly better (depending on the instance at hand). Roughly speaking, we improve the previous algorithm by taking into account the simple fact that it sufﬁces to send each packet x i ∈ X only to those clients that do not hold it. Some modiﬁcations are needed in our algorithm to utilize this trivial observation.\nIn this paper, we consider the cooperative data exchange problem for general topologies G in the combinatorial in- tegral setting. We establish both upper and lower bounds on the multiplicative approximation ratio that one may ob- tain efﬁciently by tying our problem to certain well studied combinatorial properties of G. Our achievability results are based on communication schemes that do not involve coding and in such imply bounds on the coding advantage of the problem at hand. Our results address the setting of undirected networks. Extending our results to the case of directed graphs (by studying directed analogs to dominating sets) involves modiﬁcations in our analysis and is subject to future research."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R.
