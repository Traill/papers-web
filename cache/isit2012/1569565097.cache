In spite of this recognition, however, optimally designing a wireless network across layers to minimize delay remains an open problem even in the simplest scenarios.\nConsider a two-hop network with one source node (S), one half-duplex relay node (R), and one destination node (D) under i.i.d. on-off fading. Both S and R are equipped with inﬁnite buffers and have exogenous bit arrivals. R may forward S trafﬁc using some predetermined protocol. Under a conventional decode-and-forward (DF) strategy (cf. Fig. 1 (a)), a scheduling slot is divided into two phases, where a listening phase (S-R) is always followed by a retransmission phase (R-D). As a result, the maximum throughput from S to D is restricted by the instantaneous ﬂow balance constraint, i.e., the minimum of the throughput from S to R and the throughput from R to D. Under random link connectivity, the throughput from S to D is non-zero only when both the S-R link and the R-D link are connected. This can be seen in Fig. 1 (a).\nConsider now a cross-layer buffered decode-and-forward (BDF) protocol which exploits the random nature of trafﬁc arrivals and queueing, as well as the random link connectivity, to maximize network performance. Under BDF (cf. Fig. 1 (b)), due to buffering at R, a scheduling slot can be adaptively\nallocated for the S-R transmission or the R-D transmission, according to the queue lengths and link quality. Here, the throughput to D can be made non-zero as long as the R-D link is connected. While the BDF protocol appears to offer clear advantages, it is not clear how to design the protocol to minimize overall network delay. For while buffering bits at R can improve the future throughput and hence reduce the future delay cost, it is not conducive to reducing the current delay cost, as the bits buffered at R experience longer delay. It remains unclear how to take advantage of the buffering at R to balance the current delay cost with the future delay cost so as to minimize the average delay.\nIn recent years, throughput-optimal control [2] and delay- optimal control [3], [4] have been considered in the context of different networks. Throughput-optimal control, as imple- mented by (for instance) the Dynamic Backpressure Algorithm (DBP) [2], ensures the stability of the queueing network if the arrival rate vector falls within the stability region. This algorithm maximizes the throughput in an elegant manner. However, it cannot guarantee good delay performance in general. Delay-optimal control, which focuses on minimizing some function of average delay, is on the other hand a more difﬁcult problem. Markov Decision Processes (MDP) can be used to optimize delay performance. However, brute-force solutions for MDP are usually not practical due to the curse of dimensionality [3]. In [4], delay-optimal link selection is examined for a multi-hop tandem queueing network under a simpliﬁed model in which all links are always connected and one ﬁxed length packet can be delivered over one hop at a time under the primary interference constraint. The delay- optimal policy is obtained using the technique of forward induction. This result, while elegant, cannot be extended to\na more general setup with random packet lengths and random link connectivity. In general, delay-optimal control is an open problem even for the case of a simple two-hop network with fading channels.\nIn this paper, we shall tackle some of the technical chal- lenges inherent in delay-optimal control of multi-hop net- works. Within the context of the two-hop half-duplex network with fading, we dynamically schedule the link transmissions (S-R link and/or R-D link) according to the instantaneous queue lengths and link quality at S and R to minimize the average bit delay. We introduce a new approach whereby an actual discrete time system (ADTS) is approximated using a virtual continuous time system (VCTS). Using dynamic programming, we recursively solve the delay minimization problem in the VCTS in terms of a simpler prototype problem, which can be addressed using continuous-time optimal control techniques. We show that the obtained solution in the VCTS is asymptotically optimal in the ADTS. Our solution has a closed-form expression and does not require knowledge of the arrival statistics. Finally, using renewal theory and the theory of random walks, we analyze the average delay resulting from the asymptotically optimal solution.\nIn this section, we elaborate on the system topology and physical layer model, the queueing model, and the buffered decode-and-forward (BDF) protocol.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2, we consider a simple two-hop network with one source node (S), one half-duplex relay node (R), and one destination node (D). S cannot deliver packets directly to D due to limited coverage and has to communicate to D with the help of R via the S-R link and the R-D link. We consider a discrete-time system, in which the time axis is partitioned into scheduling slots with slot duration ∆t, indexed by k (k = 0, 1 · · · ). The k-th slot corresponds to the time interval [k∆t, (k + 1)∆t).\nWe model the S-R link and the R-D link as additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with i.i.d. random link connectivity. Let G s,k , G r,k ∈ G {0, 1} denote the link connectivity state information (CSI) of the S-R link and the R- D link at the k-th slot, respectively, where 1 denotes connected and 0 not connected. Let G k = (G s,k , G r,k ) ∈ G G × G denote the joint CSI at the k-th slot.\n1 is 1 2 . Furthermore, {G s,k } and {G r,k } are independent of each other.\nAssume S and R have the same transmit power P and the noise variances are 1. Therefore, the maximum transmission rate of the S-R link when G s,k = 1 or of the R-D link when G r,k = 1 is r = W log 2 (1 + P ) (bit/s), where W is the bandwidth. We consider a half-duplex system where S and R cannot transmit simultaneously on the same frequency in the same time slot. We allow continuous frequency sharing between the S-R link and the R-D link over the spectrum W . B. Queueing Model\nThere are two bit ﬂows in the system as illustrated in Fig. 2. One ﬂow originates at S and is destined for D via R. The other ﬂow originates at R and is destined for D. Both S and R are equipped with inﬁnite buffers. The buffer at S is used to hold the exogenous bit arrivals from S. The buffer at R is used to hold both the exogenous bit arrivals from R as well as the bit ﬂow from S. Therefore, the simple two-hop network can be modeled by 2 tandem queues. As illustrated in Fig. 3, we consider the arrival processes with deterministic inter-arrival interval ∆T and random amount of bit arrivals at the beginning of each interval. For clarity, we assume ∆T ∆t is an integer. ∆T ∆t slots are grouped as a frame with frame duration ∆T and indexed by n (n = 0, 1, · · · ). The n-th frame corresponds to the time interval [t n , t n +1 ), where t n n ∆T . Let Z n = (Z s,n , Z r,n ) denote the joint random arrivals at the beginning of the n-th frame (at time t n ), where Z s,n and Z r,n denote the number of bits arriving to S and R, respectively.\nAssumption 2 (Bursty Source Model): Z s,n ∈ [B s , ¯ B s ] (0 ≤ B s ≤ ¯ B s ) and Z r,n ∈ [B r , ¯ B r ] (0 ≤ B r ≤ ¯ B r ) are bounded i.i.d. (over frames) with means Z s E [Z s,n ] and Z r E [Z r,n ], respectively. In addition, the processes {Z s,n } and {Z r,n } are independent of each other.\nLet Q s,k ∈ Q and Q r,k ∈ Q denote the queue state infor- mation (QSI) (in number of bits) at the S and R queue at the beginning of the k-th slot, respectively, where Q [0, +∞) denotes the QSI state space. Let Q k = Q s,k , Q r,k ∈ Q\nQ × Q and S k = Q s,k + Q r,k denote the joint QSI and the sum queue length at the beginning of the k-th slot. C. Buffered Decode-and-Forward (BDF) Protocol\nWe now consider using the BDF protocol to exploit the potential beneﬁt of buffering at R under random link connec- tivity.\n\u2022 S-R link: S transmits information bits to R when the S-R link is connected. R decodes and stores the information bits from S in its buffer together with its exogenous bit arrivals.\n\u2022 R-D link: R can transmit the bits (including the R bits from S and the exogenous bit arrivals to R) in its buffer to D when the R-D link is connected.\nUsing the buffer at R, BDF can adaptively allocate a schedul- ing slot to either the S-R transmission or the R-D transmission according to the joint QSI and CSI. The dynamic link schedul- ing is characterized by a link selection policy described in Section III-A.\nIn this section, we ﬁrst introduce the link selection policy and elaborate on the joint QSI dynamics. We then formulate the delay-optimal link selection problem.\nConsider a ﬁnite time horizon over K slots, i.e., {0, · · · , K − 1}. Let α s,k (Q, G), α r,k (Q, G) ∈ [0, 1] denote the portion of the bandwidth allocated to the S-R link and the R-D link in the k-th slot, respectively, where Q = (Q s , Q r ) and G = (G s , G r ) are the joint QSI and the joint CSI, respectively. We now deﬁne the link selection (i.e., frequency sharing) policy and admissible link selection policy.\nDeﬁnition 1 (Link Selection Policy): A link selection pol- icy is denoted by π \t (α 0 , · · · , α K− 1 ), where α k = (α s,k , α r,k ) : Q × G → [0, 1] 2 is the mapping from the joint QSI Q and the joint CSI G to the link selection (frequency sharing) actions when the system is in the k-th time slot (k = 0, · · · , K − 1).\nDeﬁnition 2 (Admissible Link Selection Policy): Let φ de- note the set of all mappings α k , which satisfy the following conditions for any (Q, G) ∈ Q × G and k = 0, · · · , K − 1:\n(a) α s,k (Q, G) + α r,k (Q, G) = I[Q s G s > 0 or Q r G r > 0] (orthogonal link selection).\n(b) α s,k (Q, G) = 0 if G s = 0 and α r,k (Q, G) = 0 if G r = 0 (link not connected).\n(c) α s,k (Q, G) = 0 if Q s = 0 and −α r,k (Q, G)G r + α s,k (Q, G)G s ≥ 0 if Q r = 0 (no bit left to transmit).\nThe set of all admissible link selection policies is denoted by Π {(α 0 , · · · , α K− 1 ) : α k ∈ φ, k = 0, · · · , K − 1}. B. Queue Dynamics\nGiven an initial joint QSI Q − 0 at time 0 − and an admissible link selection policy π = (α 0 , · · · , α K− 1 ) ∈ Π, the joint QSI Q k evolves according to the following queue dynamics:\nmax{x, 0}, I[·] denotes the indicator function and N denotes the set of natural numbers. The conditional time-average expected sum queue length over K slots under π ∈ Π is given by:\n1 K\nwhere E G K [·] denotes the conditional expectation w.r.t. the distribution of the joint CSI over K slots {G k : k = 0, · · · , K − 1} G K , conditioned on the random bit arrivals {Z n : n = 0, · · · , N −1} (N = K ∆t ∆T ) and S k = Q s,k +Q r,k evolves according to (1). The time-average bit arrival rate (bit/s) over K slots is λ K 1 T N − 1 n =0 (Z s,n + Z r,n ), where T = K∆t. Thus, by Little\u2019s Law (over the ﬁnite horizon), the conditional time-average expected bit delay over K slots under π ∈ Π is given by:\nNote that for given K < ∞, λ K , S π K and D π K are in general random variables with randomness induced by the random bit arrivals {Z n : n = 0, · · · , N − 1}.\nWe wish to ﬁnd an optimal admissible link selection policy π ∗ ∈ Π to minimize the random time-average expected sum queue length S π K in (2) over ﬁnite K slots with probability 1 (w.p.1.), equivalently minimizing the random time-average expected bit delay D π K in (3) w.p.1. Speciﬁcally, for any Q − 0\nRemark 1 (Interpretation of Problem 1): π ∗ ∈ Π is opti- mal in a very strong sense. π ∗ ∈ Π uniformly minimizes S π K for any sample path of bit arrivals over any ﬁnite horizon K < ∞. In addition, if S π ∗ ∞ \t lim K→∞ S π ∗ K exists w.p.1., π ∗ ∈ Π minimizes S π ∞ .\nIn this section, we ﬁrst deﬁne a virtual continuous time system (VCTS) and formulate the delay-optimal link selection problem for the VCTS. This is the continuous counterpart of Problem 1 for the actual discrete time system (ADTS). We then establish the relationship between the ADTS and the VCTS.\nDeﬁnition 3 (Virtual Continuous Time System): A VCTS is a ﬁctitious continuous time system with joint QSI q(t). Given Q − 0 and a policy ω ∈ Ω, the ﬁctitious joint QSI q (t) ∈ Q evolves according to the following dynamics:\nwhere t n = n∆T , q(0 − ) = Q − 0 , δ(·) denotes the Dirac Delta function, ω = (ω s , ω r ) : Q × G × [0, T ) → [0, 1] 2 and Ω are the link selection policy and the set of admissible link selection policies for the VCTS 1 . g = (g s , g r ) ∈ G has the same distribution as the actual joint CSI G k ∈ G.\nwhere s(t) = q s (t) + q r (t) evolves according to (4). Note that for given T < ∞, s ω T is in general a random variable with randomness induced by the random bit arrivals {Z n : n = 0, · · · , N − 1}.\nSimilar to Problem 1 for the ADTS, for any Q − 0 and any T < ∞, the delay-optimal link selection problem for the VCTS is formulated as follows:\nUsing discrete time dynamic programming and continuous time optimal control for the link selection problems in the ADTS and VCTS, respectively, we have the following theorem which summarizes the relationship between the optimal value of Problem 1 in the ADTS and the optimal value of Problem 2 in the VCTS.\nGiven any Q − 0 and any K < ∞ slots (i.e., T = K∆t seconds), we have\nIn addition, for any admissible policy ω ∈ Ω for the VCTS, denote its corresponding admissible policy for the ADTS by π(ω) \t (α 0 , · · · , α K− 1 ) ∈ φ, where α k (Q, G) =\n(Q, G, k∆t) for all (Q, G) and k = 0, · · · , K − 1. Then, we also have S π (ω) K = s ω T + O( ∆t ∆T ) w.p.1., ∀ω ∈ Ω.\nRemark 2 (Interpretation of Theorem 1): The minimum average sum queue length of the ADTS differs from that of the VCTS by O( ∆t ∆T ) only, which is very small if ∆T ∆t. As a result, instead of solving Problem 1 in the ADTS (which is difﬁcult), we solve Problem 2 in the VCTS, for which the solution is a good approximation to the solution for Problem 1.\nIn this section, we obtain an asymptotically optimal solution to Problem 1 in the ADTS by solving Problem 2 in the VCTS.\nFirst, we introduce a -link selection policy. As illustrated in Fig 4, we partition the state space of the joint QSI Q into 5 regions, i.e., Q = ∪ 5 i =1 Q i and Q i ∩ Q j = ∅ (∀i = j). Note that the partition of Q is parameterized by . Based on this partition, we deﬁne a stationary link selection policy\n        \n        \n(0, 1[Q r > 0]), Q ∈ Q, G = (0, 1) (1[Q s > 0], 0), Q ∈ Q, G = (1, 0)\n(0, 1), \t Q ∈ Q 1 ∪ Q 2 ∪ Q 3 , G = (1, 1) ( 1 2 , 1 2 ), \t Q ∈ Q 4 , G = (1, 1)\nRemark 3 (Features of α ): Consider G = (1, 1). When Q ∈ Q 1 ∪ Q 2 ∪ Q 3 , α removes bits from the R queue ﬁrst. Since bits at R have shorter service time (one hop) than bits at S (two hops), higher priority is given to the bits at the R queue. The motivation is to maximize the aggregate departure rate towards the destination node (so as to minimize the sum queue length) in a greedy manner 2 . When Q ∈ Q 4 ,\ndelivers the S bits to D by frequency sharing between the S-R link and the R-D link, where the R queue remains unchanged, while the S queue decreases until Q s = Q r . The function of the parameter is to retain some left-over bits at the R queue so as not to miss a good R-D link opportunity when G = (0, 1). Note that α does not require knowledge of the exogenous arrival statistics or the exact queue length at S and R when Q r > . However, when Q r ≤ , it needs to compare Q s and Q r .\nNext, we show that α in (7) is optimal for Problem 2 in the VCTS as → 0. Problem 2 in the VCTS is still a difﬁcult dynamic optimal control problem. We ﬁrst consider a simpler prototype problem in one inter-packet arrival interval and obtain the optimal solution. Then, using the delay mini- mization technique in [1], we show that the optimal solution for the prototype problem can recursively solve Problem 2 over multiple arrivals. In this way, we obtain the following theorem.\nWe ﬁrst recursively show that in the VCTS, the average delay of α in (7) and that of α ∗ 0 + in Theorem 2 differ by O( ∆T ). Let π \t π (α ) = (α , · · · , α ) ∈ Π be the corresponding -link selection policy for the ADTS. We then show using Theorem 1 that π is asymptotically optimal for the ADTS when = r∆t.\nTheorem 3 (Asymptotically Optimal Solution of Problem 1): For any Q − 0 and any K < ∞ slots (i.e. T = K∆t seconds), we have S π K = s α ∗ 0+ T + O( ∆t ∆T ) w.p.1., where = r∆t. In other words, π is an asymptotically optimal solution of Problem 1 in the ADTS.\nIn this section, we analyze the limiting average sum queue length S π ∞ of the ADTS under the asymptotically optimal link selection policy π . One challenge is handling the effect of the left-over bits due to the previous arrivals. We ﬁrst use the theory of random walks to study the distribution of the number of left-over bits in the R queue and the S queue, respectively. We then analyze the average sum queue length using renewal theory.\nDeﬁne Z 2 s E [Z 2 s,k ], Z 2 r E [Z 2 r,k ] and ∆Z n [Z s,n − Z r,n ] + . Note that ∆Z n ∈ [B, ¯ B ] (B = [B s − ¯ B r ] + , ¯ B = [ ¯ B s − B r ] + ) is i.i.d. w.r.t. n. Deﬁne ∆Z 2 E [∆Z 2 n ]. The following lemma summarizes the limiting average sum queue length S π ∞ of the ADTS under π .\n, the limiting average sum queue length of the ADTS under π ( = r∆t) is given by S π ∞ = s α ∗ 0+ ∞ + O( ∆t ∆T ) w.p.1. with s α ∗ 0+ ∞ bounded by s α ∗ 0+ L,∞ ≤ s α ∗ 0+ ∞ ≤ s α ∗ 0+ U,∞ , where\nr ∆T + (L 2 1 + 2(L 2 1 L 2 2 )\n3r∆T \t (9) Here, L 1 = 1 l ∗\n, where 3 l ∗ 1 > 0 is the unique positive root of the semi-invariant moment generating function of Z s,n + Z r,n − ∆Z n − 1 2 r ∆T , i.e., M 1 (l) = ln E[e Z s,n +Z r,n − ∆Z n − 1 2 r ∆T ], and l ∗ 2 > 0 is the unique positive root of the semi-invariant moment gen- erating function of 3 4 (Z s,n + Z r,n ) + 1 4 ∆Z n − 3 8 r ∆T , i.e., M 2 (l) = ln E[e 3 4 (Z s,n +Z r,n )+ 1 4 ∆Z n − 3 8 r ∆T l ]. Furthermore,\n+ 2 ¯ B 3r , 4 we have L 1 = L 2 1 = L 2 = L 2 2 = 0, and hence s α ∗ 0+ U,∞ = s α ∗ 0+ L,∞ = s α ∗ 0+ ∞ . Here, the joint random arrivals can be completely delivered to the D node in the VCTS under\n, i.e., there are no left-over bits in either the S buffer or the R buffer at the end of each frame. This corresponds to the small loading case, in which the general average sum queue length bounds reduce to the exact average sum queue length. For example, the small loading case corresponds to the SNR ≥8 dB in Fig. 5.\nRemark 5 (Performance Comparison in ADTS): As illus- trated in Fig. 5, the -link selection policy achieves better delay performance than the DBP link policy and the CSI only policy by utilizing resources efﬁciently based on both the joint QSI and CSI. When G = (1, 1), the -link selection policy gives higher priority to the R bits with shorter service time and retain some left-over bits at R so as not to miss a good R-D link opportunity when G = (0, 1)."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"E.
