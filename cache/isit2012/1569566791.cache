This is unfortunate, since the arithmetic over rings can be much simpler when compared to the arithmetic over the ﬁelds. Therefore, stabilizer codes over rings might be an interesting choice in applications of fault-tolerant quantum computing.\nIn this paper, we develop the theory of stabilizer codes over Frobenius rings. We brieﬂy discuss the discretization using nice error bases. Then we establish the connection of stabilizer codes to classical codes. Subsequently we restrict our attention to the ﬁnite chain rings to get good estimates for the minimum distance of stabilizer codes over such rings.\nLet R be a ﬁnite ring with q elements. We denote by B = {|x | x ∈ R} an orthonormal basis of C q with respect to the usual hermitian inner product.\nThe addition and multiplication in the ring R will be used to deﬁne unitary shift and multiplication operators on C q . For each a, b in R, we deﬁne a shift operator X(a) : C q → C q and a multiplication operator Z(b) : C q → C q by\nwhere x in R, and χ is an irreducible character of the additive abelian group (R, +).\nLet us consider the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt inner prod- uct A | B = 1 q tr(A \u2020 B) on the set of linear operators of C q , where tr denotes the trace of a matrix, and A \u2020 is the adjoint of the operator A. Our goal is to determine when the set\nforms an orthonormal basis of the set of linear operators on C q .\nGiven a character χ of the additive group (R, +) and a ring element b in R, we observe that χ b (x) := χ(bx) is again a character of (R, +).\nProposition 1. The operators E = {X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ R} form an orthonormal basis with respect to the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt inner product if and only if C = {χ b | b ∈ R} is the set of all irreducible characters of the additive group (R, +).\nLet R be a ﬁnite ring. We denote by Irr(R) = Hom((R, +), C × ) the set of irreducible characters of the additive group (R, +). We say that an irreducible character χ of (R, +) is generating if and only if Irr(R) = {χ b | b ∈ R}, where χ b (x) = χ(bx) for all x in R. A ﬁnite ring R does not necessarily have a generating character. We call a ring nice if and only if it has a generating character. From the deﬁnition of Frobenius rings which says a ring is Frobenius if and only if it admits a left or a right generating character it implies that a Frobenius ring is a nice ring. Thus for a Frobenius ring, the operators X(a)Z(b) form an orthonormal basis.\nLemma 2. If R is a ﬁnite Frobenius ring with generating character χ, then the set E = {X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ R} is a nice error basis on C q .\nProof: A Frobenius ring is a nice ring by [3, Theorem 7], hence E is a nice error basis.\nLet a = (a 1 , . . . , a n ) and b = (b 1 , . . . , b n ) in R n . By slight abuse of notation, we deﬁne shift and multiplication operators on n quantum system with state space C q ⊗ · · · ⊗ C q ∼ = C q n by\nX(a) = X(a 1 ) ⊗ X(a 2 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ X(a n ), Z(b) = Z(b 1 ) ⊗ Z(b 2 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Z(b n ).\nHaving deﬁned the operators on the space C q n , and the proof for nice error basis above we state the following corollary.\nCorollary 3. The set E = {X(a)Z(b)|a, b ∈ R n } is a nice error basis on C q n .\nNow let us consider the error group generated by the the nice error basis above. By including scalar multiples of the operators of the error basis, we get its associated error group as follows:\nwhere ω = exp(2πi/m) is a primitive root of unity and m is the exponent of the group (R, +).\nThe next proposition gives a convenient criterion to decide whether two operators of the error group commute.\nProposition 4. Let R be a nice ring with generating character χ. Let a, b and a , b be elements of R n . Then the operators X(a)Z(b) and X(a )Z(b ) of the error group commute if and only if χ(b · a − b · a) = 1 (where \u2019.\u2019 represents the regular inner product) holds.\nTherefore, we can conclude that X(a)Z(b) and X(a )Z(b ) commute if and only if χ(b · a − b · a) = 1, as claimed.\nConsider the additive group of the ring R. For each char- acter χ in Hom(R, C × ) there exists a unique function ψ in Hom(R, Q/Z) such that\nThe properties (1), (2), and (3) of the next lemma show that · | · χ is a Z-bilinear form, and the properties (4) and (5) show that the form is left- and right nondegenerate.\nLemma 5. Let R be a nice ring with generating character χ. Then\nholds for all u 1 , u 2 , v and u, v 1 , v 2 in R 2n , and all n in Z. Furthermore,\nProof: The properties (1), (2), and (3) follow from the biadditivity of the dot product, the distributive law, and the fact that ψ is a homomorphism.\nTo prove property (4), consider an element u = (u 0 , . . . , u n−1 |u n , . . . , u 2n−1 ) in R 2n . Seeking a contradic- tion, suppose that u = 0 but u | v χ = 0 holds for all v in R 2n . Let i be the smallest index such that u i = 0. Let d i denote the element in R 2n that takes the value 1 at coordinate i + n (mod 2n) and is 0 everywhere else. Then u | d i r χ = 0 for all r in R shows that (i) the left ideal Ru i must be contained in the kernel of χ if i is in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1; (ii) the\nright ideal u i R must be contained in the kernel of χ if i is in the range n ≤ i ≤ 2n − 1. Since χ is a generating character, any right or left ideal contained in the kernel of χ must be {0}, so u i must be 0, contradicting our assumption that u = 0.\nWe call u and v in R 2n orthogonal, written u ⊥ v, if and only if u | v χ = 0. For a subset S of R 2n , we deﬁne\nS ⊥ = {u ∈ R 2n | s | u χ = 0 for all s ∈ S} ⊥ S = {u ∈ R 2n | u | s\nIn addition to · | · χ , it will be convenient to deﬁne a form · | · s : R 2n × R 2n → R by\nWe write u ⊥ s v iff u | v s = 0. The forms are related as follows:\nThe following lemma establishes the relationship between the cardinality of code C and its dual codes C ⊥ and ⊥ C.\nLemma 6. Let R be a nice ring with generating character χ. Let C be a subgroup of (R 2n , +). Then\nProof: For each v in R 2n , the map Φ v : R 2n → C given by\nis an irreducible character of (R 2n , +). The set {Φ v | v ∈ R 2n } actually contains all irreducible characters of (R 2n , +), since it follows from Lemma 5 (5) that Φ v = Φ v if and only if v = v .\nThe set of characters of (R 2n , +) that are equal to 1 when restricted to C is given by {Φ v | v ∈ C ⊥ }, hence there are precisely |C ⊥ | such characters. On the other hand, the characters of (R 2n , +) that are equal to 1 when restricted to C correspond to the inﬂations of characters of the quotient group R 2n /C, hence there are [R 2n : C] such characters. Therefore, we have |C||C ⊥ | = |C|[R 2n : C] = |R 2n |, as claimed.\nLet R be a nice ring and n a positive integer. Suppose that the group X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ R n has exponent m. Let ω denote a primitive mth root of unity, ω = exp(2πi/m). We deﬁne the error group G n generated by the operators X(a)Z(b), a, b ∈ R n , as\nThe center Z(G n ) of the group G n is given by Z(G n ) = {ω c 1 | c ∈ Z}, a group of order m.\nWe deﬁne the weight wt(g) of an element g in G n to be the number of non-scalar tensor components of g. For (a|b) in R 2n , we deﬁne its symplectic weight swt((a|b)) to be the number of indices i such that a i = 0 or b i = 0. It follows that wt(ω c X(a)Z(b)) = swt((a|b)).\nLet R be a ring with q elements. Let S be a subgroup of G n . The stabilizer code Fix(S) associated with S is given by\nIn general, a quantum code Q is a subspace of C q n . We call Q a stabilizer code if and only if there exists a subgroup S of G n such that Fix(S) = Q.\nTheorem 7. An ((n, K, d)) R stabilizer code exists if and only if there exists an additive code C ≤ R 2n of size |C| = |R| n /K such that C ≤ C ⊥ and swt(C ⊥ \\ C) = d if K > 1, and swt(C ⊥ − {0}) = d if K = 1.\nProof: Suppose that an ((n, K, d)) R stabilizer code Q exists. This implies that there exists a subgroup S of G n of order |R| n /K such that Fix(S) = Q. Let C be the subgroup of R 2n given by C ∼ = SZ(G n )/Z(G n ). Then |C| = |S| = |R| n /K. We have C ⊥ ∼ = C G n (S)/Z(G n ). Since S is an abelian group, we have SZ(G n ) ≤ C G n (S), and hence C ≤ C ⊥ . The weight of an element ω c X(a)Z(b) is equal to the swt(a|b). If K = 1 then Q is a pure quantum code, thus wt(C G n (S) \\ Z(G n )) = swt(C ⊥ − {0}) = d. If K > 1, then the elements of C G n (S) \\ SZ(G n ) have at least weight d so that swt(C ⊥ \\ C) = d.\nConversely, suppose that C is an additive code of R 2n such that |C| = |R| n /K, C ≤ C ⊥ , and swt(C ⊥ \\C) = d if K > 1, and swt(C ⊥ − {0}) = d if K=1. Let N = {ω c X(a)Z(b)|c ∈ Z and (a|b) ∈ C}. This is an abelian normal subgroup of the group G n ; indeed, it is normal because it is the pre-image of C = N/Z(G n ), and abelian since C is self-orthogonal.\nChoose a character φ of N such that φ(ω c 1) = ω c for c ∈ Z. Then\nis an orthogonal projector onto a vector space Q, because P N is idempotent in the group ring C[G n ]. We have\nEach coset of N modulo Z(G n ) contains exactly one matrix E such that Ev = v for all v in Q. Let S = {E ∈ N |Ev = v for all ∈ Q}. Then S is an abelian subgroup of G n and its order is given by |S| = |C| = |R| n /K. The vector space Q is clearly a subspace of Fix(S) and dim Q = |R| n /|S|, hence Q = Fix(S).\nIf K > 1, then an element ω c X(a)Z(b) in C G n \\SZ(G n ) cannot have weight less than d, because this would imply that (a|b) ∈ C which is not possible. If K = 1, then the same follows for K = 1. Hence Q is an ((n, K, d)) R stabilizer code.\nIn this section, we focus on stabilizer codes over ﬁnite chain rings. Finite chain rings are local rings with the additional constraint that its lattice of left ideals forms a chain. Classical linear codes over ﬁnite chain rings have been studied exten- sively in the past, see e.g. [4], [5], [6]. Our goal it to relate\nstabilizer codes over ﬁnite chain rings to stabilizer codes over ﬁnite ﬁelds.\nA ﬁnite chain ring is a ﬁnite local principal ideal ring. Let J denote the Jacobson radical of a ﬁnite chain ring R, that is, J is the unique maximal ideal of R. The smallest positive integer ν such that J ν = {0} is called the nilpotency index of J . The nilpotency index of J and the size of the ﬁnite ﬁeld R/J are two crucial parameters of a ﬁnite chain ring R, as the following well-known lemma shows.\nLemma 8. Let R be a ﬁnite chain ring with Jacobson radical J . If the ﬁnite ﬁeld R/J has q elements, and J has nilpotency index ν, then\nfor 1 ≤ i ≤ ν. In particular, the number of elements of the ring R and of its Jacobson radical J are respectively given by |R| = q ν and |J | = q ν−1 .\nProof: Since J annihilates J i /J i+1 for all i in the range 1 ≤ i < ν, we can regard J i /J i+1 as an R/J -module, so it is a vector space over the ﬁeld F = R/J . Since R is a ﬁnite chain ring, there exists an element γ in R such that J i = Rγ i , so J i is a cyclic R-module. Therefore, J i /J i+1 = J i /J J i is a one-dimensional vector space over F ; hence, it follows that |J i /J i+1 | = q for all 1 ≤ i < ν. Therefore, we can conclude that |J i | = q ν−i holds for all i in the range 1 ≤ i ≤ ν, as claimed.\nSince J i is the annihilator of J ν−i , we have R/J i ∼ = J ν−i as left R-modules; hence, |R/J i | = |J ν−i | = q i for all i in the range 1 ≤ i < ν. Furthermore, |R| = |R/J ||J | = pp ν−1 = p ν . Therefore, |R/J i | = q i holds for the full range 1 ≤ i ≤ ν, as claimed.\nLinear codes are deﬁned as modules over rings. The next lemma shows that for a linear code C over a ﬁnite commuta- tive chain ring, we have C ⊥ = C ⊥ s and later we proceed to establish the structure of modules over ﬁnite chain ring.\nLemma 9. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative chain ring with generating character χ. Let C and D be R-submodules of R 2n . Then C ⊥ D if and only if C ⊥ s D.\nProof: It follows from the deﬁnitions that C ⊥ s D implies C ⊥ D.\nConversely, suppose that C ⊥ D. Let x in C and y in D be arbitrary elements. Since C is a module, rx in C for all r in R. Since · | · s is a bilinear R-form when R is a commutative ring, we have 1 = χ( rx | y s ) = χ(r x | y s ) = χ r ( x | y s for all r in R. As χ is a generating character, this means that\nx | y s is in the kernel of all irreducible characters of (R, +), and therefore x | y s = 0. This proves that C ⊥ D implies that C ⊥ s D.\nProposition 10. Let R be a ﬁnite chain ring and R M a left R- module of ﬁnite cardinality | R M |. Suppose that the Jacobson radical J of the ring R has nilpotency index ν. The there exists a unique partition (λ 1 , . . . , λ r ) of log q | R M | with ν ≥ λ 1 ≥\nProof: For any Artinian principal ideal ring R and left R-module R M there exists a unique family (P i , n i ) i∈I such that\n(ii) the n i are positive integers such that n i does not exceed the nilpotency index of the ideal P i ;\nsee [Theorem 6.9] in [1]. A ﬁnite chain ring has a unique maximal ideal J . The claimed decomposition (1) of R M follows from this result. By Lemma 8, we have | R M | = q λ 1 +λ 2 +···+λ r , which proves that (λ 1 , . . . , λ r ) is a partition of log q | R M |.\nThe partition λ = (λ 1 , λ 2 , ..., λ n ) of log q | R M | is called the shape of the module M . We call (ν − λ n , . . . , ν − λ 2 , ν − λ 1 ) the complementary shape of λ. The conjugate λ of a partition λ is the partition λ = (λ 1 , . . . , λ λ 1 ) of log q | R M | with λ i = |{j; λ j ≥ i}|. The largest part λ 1 of the conjugate shape λ is equal to the total number of parts of λ and is called the rank of the module.\nThe next theorem establishes a relation between the shape of the code and the shape of its dual code.\nTheorem 11. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative chain ring. Let C ≤ R 2n be a linear code over R of shape λ. Then the shape of C ⊥ is the complementary shape of λ.\nProof: For each v ∈ R 2n , we have a linear map φ v : C R → R R , u → u|v s . Since R is commutative, Θ : R 2n → C # = Hom(C, R) R is linear map with kernel ker Θ = C ⊥ s , hence ker Θ = C ⊥ by Lemma 9. Furthermore, Θ is surjective, see [7, Lemma 13]. Therefore, R 2n /C ⊥ ∼ = C # , and the shapes of C # and C ⊥ are complementary. A module C and its dual C # have the same shape. Hence the shape of C ⊥ is complementary to the shape of C.\nLet R be a ring and C be a submodule of the R-module R 2n . Given a ring element r, we deﬁne the submodule quotient (C : r) as\nLet R be a ﬁnite chain ring whose Jacobson radical J is generated by γ. Let ν denote the nilpotency index of J , that is J ν = 0 and J ν−1 = 0. Consider the submodule quotient (C : γ). We can form the chain of submodule quotients:\nWe denote by C the image of C under reduction modulo J (R). This chain of codes and their reductions modulo J (R) will allow us to compare stabilizer code over rings with stabilizer codes over ﬁelds.\nLet us ﬁx some terminology. For an R-module M and an element x ∈ M , we say that (a) x has period γ i iff i is the smallest integer in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ ν satisfying γ i x = 0, and (b) x has height i iff i ∈ {0, 1, ..., ν} is the largest integer satisfying x = γ i y for some y ∈ M . Furthermore, we deﬁne\nLemma 12. Let C be an R-submodule of R 2n of shape λ. Suppose C has shape λ. Then dim (C : γ i ) = k 0 + k 1 + ... + k i where k denotes the number of parts of λ equal to ν − .\nProof: Let k be the rank of C. Then there exists a basis c 1 , c 2 , ...c k of C with periods γ λ 1 , γ λ 2 , . . . γ λ k , respectively. We assume that the basis elements are arranged in the decreas- ing order of their periods. Let e be an element in (C : γ i ); hence γ i e ∈ C. Thus, there exist r 1 , r 2 , ....r k ∈ R such that\nSince R 2n is a free module we have R 2n [γ i ] = γ ν−i R 2n . Hence every basis element c i can be written as c i = (γ ν−λ i c i1 , γ ν−λ i c i2 , ..., γ ν−λ i c in ). Therefore we can write γ i e in the form\nwhere the index j is chosen such that λ j ≥ ν − i and λ j+1 < ν − i. Hence r 1 c 1 + r 2 c 2 + ... + r j c j is also divisible by γ i . Thus\nr i c i . It follows that {c 1 , c 2 , ...c j } is a generating set of (C : γ i ). Since this set is independent, we have dim (C : γ i ) = k 0 + k 1 + ... + k i .\nWe omit the proof to save space. The argument relies on the complementarity of the shapes of C and C ⊥ , and determining the ranks of the codes involved from the shape data, see [7].\nLemma 14. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative chain ring, γ an element of R generating the Jacobson radical J of R, and ν the smallest positive integer such that J ν = {0}. Let C be an R-submodule of R 2n . Then (C : γ ν−i−1 ) ⊥ = (C ⊥ : γ i ) holds for all i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ ν − 1.\nProof: Let u = (a|b) be an arbitrary element of (C ⊥ : γ i ). It follows from the deﬁnition of a submodule quotient that rγ i u = (rγ i a|rγ i b) ∈ C ⊥ holds for all r in R. For any element v = (c|d) in the submodule quotient (C : γ ν−i−1 ), we have γ ν−i−1 v ∈ C. Therefore,\nbelongs to the kernel of χ. In other words, γ ν−1 (a.d − b.c) is in the kernel of all characters χ b with b ∈ R, hence in the kernel of all irreducible characters, so it must be 0. By [5, Corollary 2.3], it follows that a.d − b.c must be a multiple of γ, so it is in the Jacobson radical J (R). Therefore, we can conclude\nThe claim follows, since dim (C ⊥ : γ i )+dim (C : γ ν−i−1 ) = 2n by Lemma 13.\nHaving established the orthogonality of the submodule quotients, we are now ready to give a comparison of the minimum distances of the quantum codes over these rings to that over the ﬁnite ﬁelds. Recall that the weight of the error X(a)Z(b) is characterized by the symplectic weight of the corresponding vector (a|b). Also the minimum distance of the stabilizer code equals swt(C ⊥ − C). Let us denote d(C ⊥ − C) to be the minimum of all the swt(a|b) where (a|b) ∈ (C ⊥ − C). Thus we are interested in estimating the d(C ⊥ − C) as this yields the distance of the stabilizer code over the ring.\nProposition 15. Let R be a ﬁnite local principal ideal ring, γ an element of R generating the Jacobson radical J of R, and ν the smallest positive integer such that J ν = {0}. Let C be an R-submodule of R 2n satisfying C ≤ C ⊥ , that is, C is a self-orthogonal linear code over the ring R. Then\nProof: Let C ⊥ − (C : α) = {x|x ∈ C ⊥ and αx / ∈ C}. Let us consider an element x ∈ C ⊥ − (C : α), then αx ∈ C ⊥ − C. This implies that α(C ⊥ − (C : α)) ⊂ C ⊥ − C. Therefore we have d(C ⊥ − C) ≤ d(α(C ⊥ − (C : α))).\nFrom the above we have d(C ⊥ −C) ≤ d(α(C ⊥ −(C : α))). Since R is a ﬁnite local ring with Jacobson radical J , its quotient ring F = R/J is a ﬁnite ﬁeld. We can deﬁne a map ψ : αR 2n → F 2n by\nSince the annihilator of α in R is given by J , this is a well- deﬁned homomorphisms of R-modules. Since ψ is surjective and ker ψ = {0}, it follows that ψ is an isomorphism.\nWe have ψ(α((C ⊥ − (C : α)) = (C ⊥ − (C : α)). Since swt(αc) = swt ψ(αc)) = swt(c), we have\nTherefore, we can conclude that d(C ⊥ − C) ≤ d((C ⊥ − (C : α), as claimed.\nThe above bounds on the minimum distance have been established using the classical objects. However in order to generalize the comparison to stabilizer codes, we need the code over the ﬁeld also to be self orthogonal. This is possible when the projected code over the ﬁeld contains its dual, which is the case for free codes.\nTheorem 16. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative chain ring. If an (n, K, d) R free stabilizer code exists over the ring, then a corresponding (n, K, ≥ d) stabilizer code exists over the ﬁeld R/J (R) with equality achieved in the case of pure codes.\nProof: Since C ⊥ is a free code, C is also a free code. A free code satisﬁes the property that C γ i R n = γ i C. Hence we have (C : γ i ) = C f or i = 0, ..., v − 1. This implies that (C ⊥ − (C : α) = (C ⊥ − C). Hence d((C ⊥ − (C : α)) = d((C ⊥ − C)). By Proposition 15, we have d(C ⊥ − C) ≤ d(C ⊥ − C) since the codes are free. The parameters n and K remain preserved when the free code is projected onto the ﬁeld. Therefore, the ﬁrst part of the claim follows from Theorem 7.\nWe claim that the minimum distance is preserved for pure codes. Indeed, in the case of pure codes we have d(C ⊥ ) = d(C ⊥ − C). Since C ⊥ −C ⊆ C ⊥ , we have d(C ⊥ ) ≤ d(C ⊥ − C). From the properties of free codes we can write d(C ⊥ ) = d(C ⊥ ). Therefore, d(C ⊥ − C) ≤ d(C ⊥ − C), and we can conclude that d(C ⊥ − C) = d(C ⊥ − C).\nWe established the existence of stabilizer codes over Frobe- nius rings. In particular, we related quantum codes over rings to classical codes. This allowed us to give the ﬁrst systematic construction of quantum codes over rings. Subsequently, we studied the structure of stabilizer codes over ﬁnite chain rings. By developing the structure theory of modules over ﬁnite chain rings, we were able to obtain numerous structural results on stabilizer codes over ﬁnite chain rings. In particular, we established that the minimum distance of stabilizer codes corresponding to free codes over ﬁnite chain rings cannot exceed the minimum distance of stabilizer codes over ﬁnite ﬁeld.\nAcknowledgments.
