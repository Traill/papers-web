The sender X wishes to send two messages, one of them for the legitimate receivers Y 1 and Y 2 , and the other one for the ﬁrst legitimate receiver Y 1 . It also tries to keep these messages secret from the eavesdropper Z. There are two noiseless links between Y 1 and Y 2 with capacities C 1 and C 2 . There are some special cases of this channel where the secrecy capacity has been obtained. When the state information is not available, Csiszar and Korner [1] considered the general WireTap Channel (WTC), which consists of a sender, a receiver and an eavesdropper, and established the secrecy capacity. Chia and El Gamal [2] found a lower bound on the secrecy capacity of the 2-rec., 1-eav. BC. Salehkalaibar and Aref [3] established the secrecy capacity of a special class of 3-rec. BCs where the receivers exhibit a degradedness order.\nWhen the state information is available at the encoder and decoders, the parties can use this information to increase the secrecy rate. In the case of the WTC with state known non- causally at the encoder, Chen and Vinck [4] found an inner bound to the secrecy capacity. The coding scheme is based on the combination of Gelfand-Pinsker binning and Wyner\nwiretap coding. Khisti, Diggavi and Wornell [5] considered the WTC with state known causally or noncausally at the encoder and decoder and established the secret key capacity. Chia and El Gamal [6] investigated the WTC when the state is causally available at the encoder and decoder. They found an inner bound on the secrecy capacity of this channel using block Markov encoding and Shannon strategy [7].\nIn this paper, we consider the 2-rec., 1-eav. BC with two causal states and conferencing decoders. Each state is known causally at the corresponding receiver, while both states are causally available at the encoder. Each receiver wishes to send the state which is not available at the other receiver, through the noiseless link. We obtain an inner bound on the secrecy capacity region of this channel. In the achievability scheme, we use block Markov encoding [6], [8] and Shannon strategy for channels with state [7]. We make use of the states to generate two secret keys [6]. We employ the secret keys generated in one transmission block to increase the secrecy rate in the next block. The main idea in this paper is to employ the cooperation of the receivers in recovering the keys to increase the secrecy rate. This implies that if a party does not have access to both keys, it may not recover the messages. On the other hand, each receiver tries to ensure secrecy while sending the state through the noiseless link. Therefore, we consider different cases in the decoding procedure based on the cooperation- secrecy trade-off. We also establish an outer bound on the secrecy capacity region of the 2-rec., 1-eav. BC with Causal\nChannel State Information (CCSI) and conferencing. We show that the proposed bounds are tight for the 2-rec., 1-eav. BC with two keys and conferencing, when Z is a degraded version of Y 2 and Y 2 is a degraded version of Y 1 .\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we present a mathematical framework for our work. In Section III, we ﬁnd inner and outer bounds on the secrecy capacity of the 2- rec., 1-eav. BC with CCSI and conferencing, and discuss some special cases. In Section IV, the proofs of theorems are given. Conclusions are provided in Section V.\nWe denote discrete random variables with capital letters e.g., X, Y , and their realizations with lower case letters x, y. X j i\nindicates a sequence of random variables (X i , ..., X j ). We use H (.) to denote the entropy of a discrete random variable and I (.; .) to denote the mutual information between two discrete random variables. We denote by A n ε (X, Y ), the set of ε- strongly jointly typical sequences of length n, on p (x, y). A random variable X takes values in a set X . Finally, we denote the probability density function of X over X with p(x) and the conditional probability density function of X given Y by p (x|y).\nDeﬁnition 1 : A (2 nR 0 , 2 nR 1 , n ) code for the 2-receiver, 1- eavesdropper Broadcast Channel (BC) with Causal Channel State Information (CCSI) and conferencing (Fig. 1) con- sists of: i) two message sets as M 0 = {1, ..., 2 nR 0 } and M 1 = {1, ..., 2 nR 1 }, ii) two conference message sets as M 12 = {1, ..., 2 nC 1 } and M 21 = {1, ..., 2 nC 2 }, iii) an encoder that generates a symbol X i (m 0 , m 1 ) according to the conditional pmf p (x i |m 0 , m 1 , s i 1 , s i 2 , x i −1 ) for i ∈ [1 : n], iv) two conference mappings, one at each user, h 1 : S n 1 → M 12 and h 2 : S n 2 → M 21 , v) two decoders, one at each user with the mappings g 1 : M 21 × Y n 1 × S n 1 → M 0 × M 1 and g 2 : M 12 × Y n 2 × S n 2 → M 0 . The messages M 0 , M 1 , M 12 and M 21 are uniformly distributed over the message sets. The prob- ability of error is deﬁned as, P n e = Pr(g 1 (M 21 , Y n 1 , S n 1 ) = (M 0 , M 1 ) or g 2 (M 12 , Y n 2 , S n 2 ) = M 0 ). The information leak- age rate at the eavesdropper is deﬁned as 1 n I (M 0 , M 1 ; Z n ). A secrecy rate pair (R 0 , R 1 ) is said to be achievable if there exists a sequence of codes with lim n →∞ P n e = 0 and lim n →∞ inf 1 n I (M 0 , M 1 ; Z n ) = 0.\nIn this section, we ﬁrst obtain inner and outer bounds to the secrecy capacity region of the 2-rec., 1-eav. BC with CCSI and conferencing. Then, we discuss a special case where the two bounds determine the secrecy capacity.\nTheorem 1: R in is an inner bound to the secrecy capacity region of the 2-rec., 1-eav. BC with CCSI and conferencing where R in is the union of all (R 0 , R 1 ) satisfying\nR 1 ≤ I(V ; Y 1 |U, S 1 ) − I(V ; Z|U, S 1 , S 2 ) R 0 ≤ min{I(U ; Y 2 |S 2 ), I(U ; Y 1 |S 1 ),\nI (U ; Y 2 |S 1 , S 2 ) + H(S 1 |S 2 ) + min{C 2 , H (S 2 |S 1 )}− I (U ; Z|S 1 , S 2 ), I(U ; Y 1 |S 1 , S 2 ) + H(S 2 |S 1 )+\nI (U ; Y 1 |S 1 ) + H(S 1 |S 2 ) + C 2 − I(U ; Z|S 1 , S 2 ), I (U ; Y 2 |S 2 ) + H(S 2 |S 1 ) + C 1 − I(U ; Z|S 1 , S 2 ),\nmin{I(U ; Y 2 |S 2 ), I(U ; Y 1 |S 1 )} + min{C 1 + C 2 , H (S 1 , S 2 |Z)} −I(U ; Z|S 1 , S 2 )\n(1) for all distributions of the form p (s 1 , s 2 )p(u, v)p(x|u, v, s 1 , s 2 ).\nTheorem 2: R out is an outer bound on the secrecy capacity region of the 2-rec., 1-eav. BC with CCSI and conferencing where R out is the union of all (R 0 , R 1 ) satisfying\nR 0 ≤ min{I(U ; Y 2 |S 2 ), I(U ; Y 1 |S 1 )} \t (2) R 0 ≤ I(U 0 ; Y 2 , S 2 |W ) − I(U 0 ; Z|W )\n+ min{C 1 , H (S 1 |S 2 , Y 2 )} + min{C 2 , H (S 2 |S 1 , Y 2 )} (3) R 0 ≤ I(U 0 ; Y 2 |W, S 2 ) − I(U 0 ; Z|W, S 2 ) + C 1 + H(S 2 |Z)\n(4) R 1 ≤ I(V 0 ; Y 1 , S 1 |U 1 ) − I(V 0 ; Z|U 1 ) + C 2 \t (5) R 1 ≤ I(V ; Y 1 , S 1 , S 2 |U 2 ) − I(V ; Z|U 2 ) \t (6) R 1 ≤ I(V ; Y 1 , S 1 |U 2 ) − I(V ; Z|U 2 ) + H(S 2 |S 1 , Y 1 ) (7)\nfor all joint distributions of the form p (w|s 1 , s 2 ). p (u 0 |w, s 1 , s 2 ).p(u|u 0 , s 1 , s 2 ).p(u 1 |u 0 , s 1 , s 2 ).p(u 2 |u 1 , s 1 , s 2 ).p(v 0 |u 1 , s 1 , s 2 ).p(v|v 0 , u 2 , s 1 , s 2 ).p(x|u 2 , v, s 1 , s 2 ).\nR 1 = 0, U = (X, S) and C 1 = 0, C 2 → ∞ in Theorems 1 and 2. Then, R in and R out specialize to the secrecy capacity of the less noisy WTC with CCSI [6]\n(8) To show this, consider the terms in R in . Note that I (U ; Y |S) = I(X; Y |S). Also, the other term can be writ- ten as I (U ; Y |S) − I(U ; Z|S) + H(S|Z) = I(X; Y |S) −\nI (X; Z|S) + H(S|Z). Now consider the term (4) in R out . This term satisﬁes the following inequalities\nwhere (a) and (b) follow from the less noisy assumption where I (U ; Y |S) ≥ I(U ; Z|S), for all U such that (U, S) → (X, S) → (Y, Z) form a Markov chain.\nWe show that Theorems 1 and 2 are tight for a special case. Consider the case where p (y 1 , y 2 , z |x, s 1 , s 2 ) = p(y 1 , y 2 , z |x), Z is a degraded version of Y 2 and Y 2 is a degraded version of Y 1 , i.e., Y 1 → Y 2 → Z form a Markov chain. Also, suppose that R 1 = 0. Therefore, we ﬁnd the secrecy capacity of the 2-rec., 1-eav. BC with two secret keys.\nTheorem 3: C is the secrecy capacity of the 2-rec., 1-eav. BC with CCSI and conferencing when p (y 1 , y 2 , z |x, s 1 , s 2 ) =\np (y 1 , y 2 , z |x), R 1 = 0 and Y 1 → Y 2 → Z form a Markov chain where,\nI (X; Y 2 ), I(X; Y 2 |Z)+ min{C 1 , H (S 1 |S 2 )}+ min{C 2 , H (S 2 |S 1 )}\nProof: Achievability follows from Theorem 1 by setting R 1 = 0, V = U = X and considering the fact that I(X; Y 2 ) ≤ I (X; Y 1 ) for all distributions of the form p(x)p(s 1 , s 2 ). To establish the converse, we use the degradedness assumption to strengthen the terms in (3). For example consider the following term\nI (U 0 ; Y 2 , S 2 |W ) − I(U 0 ; Z|W ) + C 1 + H(S 2 |S 1 , Y 2 ) (a) = I(U\n≤ I(X; Y 2 ) − I(X; Z) + C 1 + H(S 2 |S 1 ) = I(X; Y 2 |Z) + C 1 + H(S 2 |S 1 ).\nwhere (a) follows from the distribution p(y 1 , y 2 , z |x, s 1 , s 2 ) = p (y 1 , y 2 , z |x). (b) and (c) follow from the degradedness as- sumption. Similarly, other terms of (9) can be obtained.\nThe proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 are provided in the next section.\nWe outline the coding scheme. We send B − 1 independent messages over B n −transmission blocks. Split message M 0 into two independent messages M 00 ∈ [1 : 2 nR 00 ], and M 01 ∈ [1 : 2 nR 01 ], thus R 0 = R 00 +R 01 . Let R 0 ≥ R 0 and R 1 ≥ R 1 . Also, choose two rates R k 1 and R k 2 such that R k 1 ≤ C 1 and R k 2 ≤ C 2 . Message codebook is generated as follows. We randomly generate 2 nR 0 sequences u n (l 0 ), l 0 ∈ [1 : 2 nR 0 ] and partition these sequences into 2 nR 00 bins. The codewords in each bin are further partitioned into 2 nR 01 equal size sub- bins B 1 (m 00 , m 01 ). For each u n (l 0 ), we randomly generate 2 nR 1 sequences v n (l 0 , l 1 ), l 1 ∈ [1 : 2 nR 1 ] and partition these sequences into 2 nR 1 bins B 2 (l 0 , m 1 ). We then generate key codebook. We randomly partition the set of s n 1 sequences into 2 nR k1 bins B 12 (k 1 ), k 1 ∈ [1 : 2 nR k1 ] and then generate a sequence w n 1 (k 1 ) for each index k 1 ∈ [1 : 2 nR k1 ]. We also randomly partition the set of s n 2 sequences into 2 nR k2 bins B 21 (k 2 ), k 2 ∈ [1 : 2 nR k2 ] and then generate a sequence w n 2 (k 2 ) for each index k 2 ∈ [1 : 2 nR k2 ]. The key which is used in block b is k (b − 1) = (k 1 (b − 1), k 2 (b − 1)), where k 1 (b − 1) and k 2 (b − 1) are bin indices of s n 1 (b − 1) and s n 2 (b − 1) in block b − 1, respectively.\nEncoding in block b is as follows. To send messages (m 0 (b), m 1 (b)) = (m 00 (b), m 01 (b), m 1 (b)), m 01 (b) is en- crypted with k (b − 1) to ﬁnd the index m 01 (b) = m 01 (b) ⊕ (k 1 (b − 1), k 2 (b − 1)). To ensure secrecy, we must have R 01 ≤ R k 1 + R k 2 [7]. The transmitter selects sequences u n (l 0 (b)) ∈ B 1 (m 00 (b), m 01 (b)) and v n (l 0 (b), l 1 (b)) ∈ B 2 (l 0 (b), m 1 (b)). The transmitter then computes u 1,i = u 1 (u i (l 0 ), s 1,i , s 2,i ) and v 1,i = v 1 (v i (l 0 , l 1 ), s 1,i , s 2,i ) using\nShannon\u2019s strategy and sends a randomly generated symbol X i ∼ p(x i |u 1,i , v 1,i , s 1,i , s 2,i ) for i ∈ [(b − 1)n + 1 : bn ]. The ﬁrst and second users send indices k 1 (b − 1) and k 2 (b − 1), respectively. At the end of block b, the encoder and users declare bin indices (k 1 (b), k 2 (b)) of state sequences (s n 1 (b), s n 2 (b)) as the key to be used in block b + 1. Mes- sage parts m 00 (b) and m 1 (b) are transmitted using Wyner wiretap coding. These messages can be kept secret from the eavesdropper provided that R 0 − R 00 ≥ I(U ; Z, S 1 , S 2 ) and R 1 − R 1 ≥ I(V ; Z, S 1 , S 2 |U ), therefore (R 0 − R 00 ) + (R 1 − R 1 ) ≥ I(V ; Z, S 1 , S 2 ). The secrecy analysis of the message part m 01 (b) involves keeping k(b − 1) secret from the eavesdropper. We show that this step can be done if R k 1 + R k 2 ≤ H(S 1 , S 2 |Z), using the approach of [6]. For the analysis of the information leakage rate, see Appendix A.\nThe main part of the proof is the decoding procedure. We consider different cases based on the capacities of conferenc- ing links and the secrecy constraint obtained above. In the ﬁrst case, each user may be able to reconstruct the state sequence which is available at the other user, while ensuring the secrecy constraint, i.e.,\n\u2022 H (S 1 |S 2 )+H(S 2 |S 1 ) ≤ H(S 1 , S 2 |Z), H(S 1 |S 2 ) ≤ C 1 , H (S 2 |S 1 ) ≤ C 2\nIn block b, user 1 upon receiving k 2 (b−1), ﬁnds s n 2 (b−1) such that s n 2 (b − 1) ∈ B 21 (k 2 (b − 1)) and (s n 2 (b − 1), s n 1 (b − 1)) ∈ A n . This can be done with an arbitrarily small probability of error if R k 1 = H(S 1 |S 2 ) and R k 2 = H(S 2 |S 1 ). User 1 then ﬁnds l 0 (b − 1) and l 1 (b − 1) such that (v n (l 0 (b − 1), l 1 (b − 1)), u n (l 0 (b − 1)), s n 1 (b − 1), s n 2 (b − 1), y n 1 (b − 1)) ∈ A n . This can be done with an arbitrarily small probability of error if\nR 0 + R 1 ≤ I(V ; Y 1 , S 1 , S 2 ) \t (10) R 1 ≤ I(V ; Y 1 , S 1 , S 2 |U ). \t (11)\nUsing l 0 (b−1) and (k 1 (b−2), k 2 (b−2)), it recovers m 01 (b−1) where m 01 (b−1) is the bin index of l 0 (b−1) and m 01 (b−1) = m 01 (b − 1) ⊕ (k 1 (b − 2), k 2 (b − 2)). Similarly, the following condition can be found for user 2,\nIn another case, a user may only reconstruct the unknown part of the key which is not necessarily the entire state sequence available at the other user, i.e.,\n\u2022 H (S 1 |S 2 )+H(S 2 |S 1 ) ≤ H(S 1 , S 2 |Z), H(S 1 |S 2 ) ≥ C 1 , H (S 2 |S 1 ) ≥ C 2\nIn block b, user 1 ﬁnds l 0 (b − 1) and l 1 (b − 1) such that (v n (l 1 (b − 1), l 0 (b − 1)), u n (l 0 (b − 1)), s n 1 (b − 1), y n 1 (b − 1)) ∈ A n . Using l 0 (b − 1) and (k 1 (b − 2), k 2 (b − 2)), it recovers m 01 (b − 1) where m 01 (b − 1) is the bin index of l 0 (b − 1) and m 01 (b − 1) = m 01 (b − 1) ⊕ (k 1 (b − 2), k 2 (b − 2)). In this case, R k 1 and R k 2 should be chosen such that R k 1 + R k 2 = min{C 1 + C 2 , H (S 1 , S 2 |Z)}. Also, we have\nR 0 + R 1 ≤ I(V ; Y 1 , S 1 ) \t (13) R 1 ≤ I(V ; Y 1 , S 1 |U ) \t (14)\nFinally, a user may be able to reconstruct the entire sequence while the other user only reconstructs the unknown part of the key which is not necessarily the entire sequence, i.e.,\n\u2022 H (S 1 |S 2 )+H(S 2 |S 1 ) ≤ H(S 1 , S 2 |Z), H(S 1 |S 2 ) ≤ C 1 , H (S 2 |S 1 ) ≥ C 2\n\u2022 H (S 1 |S 2 )+H(S 2 |S 1 ) ≤ H(S 1 , S 2 |Z), H(S 1 |S 2 ) ≥ C 1 , H (S 2 |S 1 ) ≤ C 2 .\nIn the ﬁrst case, one should choose R k 1 = H(S 1 |S 2 ) and R k 2 = C 2 . The analysis of probability of error yields con- ditions (12)-(14). For the second case, the rates R k 1 = C 1 and R k 2 = H(S 2 |S 1 ) should be chosen. The analysis of the probabaility of error yields (10)-(11) and (15). Considering (10)-(15) with their corresponding key rates and the following,\nR 0 ≥ R 0 , R 1 ≥ R 1 , R 0 = R 00 + R 01 , R 01 ≤ R k 1 + R k 2 R 0 − R 00 ≥ I(U ; Z, S 1 , S 2 )\nR 1 − R 1 ≥ I(V ; Z, S 1 , S 2 |U ) R k 1 + R k 2 ≤ H(S 1 , S 2 |Z),\nand also performing Fourier-Motzkin elimination, we obtain the terms in Theorem 1.\n= I(M 1 ; Y n 1 , S n 1 |M 0 ) + I(M 1 ; M 21 (S n 2 )|Y n 1 , S n 1 , M 0 ) + nδ ≤ I(M 1 ; Y n 1 , S n 1 |M 0 ) + H(M 21 (S n 2 )) + nδ = I(M 1 ; Y n 1 , S n 1 |M 0 ) + nC 2 + nδ\n≤ I(M 1 ; Y n 1 , S n 1 |M 0 ) − I(M 0 , M 1 ; Z n ) + nC 2 + 2nδ ≤ I(M 1 ; Y n 1 , S n 1 |M 0 ) − I(M 1 ; Z n |M 0 ) + nC 2 + 2nδ\nwhere (a) follows from Fano\u2019s inequality. (b) follows from the secrecy condition. (c) and (d) follow the Csiszar sum identity.\nNext consider the following bound on R 1 : nR 1 = H(M 1 ) = H(M 1 |M 0 )\n≤ I(M 1 ; Y n 1 , S n 1 , M 21 (S n 2 ), S n 2 |M 0 ) + nδ = I(M 1 ; Y n 1 , S n 1 , S n 2 |M 0 ) + nδ\n≤ I(M 1 ; Y n 1 , S n 1 , S n 2 |M 0 ) − I(M 0 , M 1 ; Z n ) + 2nδ ≤ I(M 1 ; Y n 1 , S n 1 , S n 2 |M 0 ) − I(M 1 ; Z n |M 0 ) + 2nδ\n(19) where (a) follows from the same steps in (17) and (18). Finally, we have the following bound on R 1 . Consider the term in (19):\n= I(V ; Y 1 , S 1 |U 2 ) + I(V ; S 2 |Y 1 , S 1 , U 2 ) − I(V ; Z|U 2 ) ≤ I(V ; Y 1 , S 1 |U 2 ) + H(S 2 |Y 1 , S 1 , U 2 ) − I(V ; Z|U 2 ) ≤ I(V ; Y 1 , S 1 |U 2 ) + H(S 2 |Y 1 , S 1 ) − I(V ; Z|U 2 )\n≤ I(M 0 ; Y n 2 , S n 2 , M 12 (S n 1 )) − I(M 0 ; Z n ) + 2nδ \t (20) ≤ I(M 0 ; Y n 2 , S n 2 , S n 1 , M 12 (S n 1 )) − I(M 0 ; Z n ) + 2nδ\n= I(M 0 ; Y n 2 , S n 2 , S n 1 , M 12 (S n 1 ), M 21 (S n 2 )) − I(M 0 ; Z n ) + 2nδ = I(M 0 ; Y n 2 , S n 2 ) − I(M 0 ; Z n )\n+I(M 0 ; M 12 (S n 1 ), S n 1 , M 21 (S n 2 )|Y n 2 , S n 2 ) + 2nδ ≤ I(M 0 ; Y n 2 , S n 2 ) − I(M 0 ; Z n )\n(21) ≤ I(M 0 ; Y n 2 , S n 2 ) − I(M 0 ; Z n )\n[I(U 0,i ; Y 2,i , S 2,i |W i ) − I(U 0,i ; Z i |W i )] +H(S n 1 |Y n 2 , S n 2 ) + H(S n 2 |Y n 2 , S n 1 ) + 2nδ\nwhere (a) follows from the same steps in (16)-(18). In the following we obtain three outer bounds on R 0 . Consider the terms in (21):\nH (M 12 (S n 1 )|Y n 2 , S n 2 ) + H(M 21 (S n 2 )|Y n 2 , S n 1 ) ≤ H(M 12 (S n 1 )) + H(M 21 (S n 2 )|Y n 2 , S n 1 )\nWe obtained bounds on the secrecy capacity region of the 2-rec., 1-eav. BC with CCSI and conferencing. We have shown that the proposed bounds determine the secrecy capacity for a special case.\nWe use Z n i to denote the received sequence, (M 0,i , M 1,i ) to denote the messages sent and K i = (K 1,i , K 2,i ) to denote the key used in block i. Deﬁne M .,i = (M 0,i , M 1,i ) and S i = (S 1,i , S 2,i ). Consider\nwhere (a) follows by the independence of M .,i and (S i , M B .,i +1 ). (b) follows because (Z n i +1 , ..., Z n B , M .,i +1 , ..., M .,B , C) → (Z n 1 , ..., Z n i , S i , C) → (M .,i , C) form a Markov chain. We bound each term separately. Consider the ﬁrst term:\nI (M 00,i , M 1,i ; Z n i |Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C) = I(L 1 , L 0 ; Z n i |Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C)\n−H(L 1 , L 0 |M 00,i , M 1,i , Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C) +H(L 1 , L 0 |M 00,i , M 1,i , Z n i , S i , C)\n≤ nI(V ; Z|S) − H(L 1 , L 0 |M 00,i , M 1,i , Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C) +H(L 1 , L 0 |M 00,i , M 1,i , Z n i , S i , C)\n≤ nI(V ; Z|S) − H(L 1 , L 0 |M 00,i , M 1,i , Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C) +n((R 0 − R 00 ) + (R 1 − R 1 ) − I(V ; Z, S) + δ)\n−H(L 1 , L 0 |M 00,i , M 1,i , Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C) + nδ = nδ + n(R 0 − R 00 ) + n(R 1 − R 1 )\n−H(L 1 , L 0 |M 00,i , M 1,i , M 01,i ⊕ K i −1 , Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C) ≤ n(R 0 − R 00 ) + n(R 1 − R 1 )\n−H(M 01,i ⊕ K i −1 |M 00,i , M 1,i , K i −1 , Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C) −n(R 0 − R 00 − R k 1 − R k 2 ) − n(R 1 − R 1 ) + nδ\nwhere (a) follows from the Markov chain (Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , C) → (Z n i , S i , C) → (V n , C) and also the memoryless property of the channel. (b) follows if the condition (R 0 − R 00 ) + (R 1 − R 1 ) ≥ I(V ; Z, S) holds. (c) follows from the inde- pendence of V and S. (d) follows from the Markov chain (Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , M 00,i , M 1,i , S i ) → (M 00,i , M 1,i , K i −1 , S i ) → (M 01,i ⊕ K i −1 , M 00,i , M 1,i , S i ). (e) follows because M 01,i\nis independent of (M 00,i , M 1,i , K i −1 , S i , C) and uniformly distributed on [1 : 2 n (R k1 +R k2 ) ]. Consider the second term:\n−I(L 1 , L 0 ; Z n i |M 00,i , M 1,i , M 01,i , Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C) ≤ nI(V ; Z|S)\n−H(L 1 , L 0 |M 00,i , M 1,i , M 01,i , Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C) +H(L 1 , L 0 |M 00,i , M 1,i , M 01,i , Z n 1 , ..., Z n i , S i , C)\n= nI(V ; Z|S) + H(L 1 , L 0 |M 00,i , M 1,i , M 01,i , Z n i , S i , C) −H(L 1 , L 0 |M 00,i , M 1,i , M 01,i , Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C)\n≤ nI(V ; Z|S) + n((R 0 − R 00 ) + (R 1 − R 1 ) − I(V ; Z, S)) −H(L 1 , L 0 |M 00,i , M 1,i , M 01,i , Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C) + nδ = n(R 0 − R 00 ) + n(R 1 − R 1 )\nwhere (a) follows if the condition (R 0 − R 00 ) + (R 1 − R 1 ) ≥ I (V ; Z, S) holds. Now consider the following term:\n= H(M 01,i ⊕ K i −1 |M 00,i , M 1,i , M 01,i , Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C)+ H (L 1 , L 0 |M 00,i , M 1,i , M 01,i , M 01,i ⊕ K i −1 , Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C) = H(K i −1 |M 00,i , M 1,i , M 01,i , Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C)\n= H(K i −1 |Z n 1 , ..., Z n i −1 , S i , C) + n(R 0 − R 00 − R k 1 − R k 2 ) +n(R 1 − R 1 ) (a) ≥ n(R 0 − R 00 ) + n(R 1 − R 1 )\nwhere (a) follows because if (R 0 − R 00 ) + (R 1 − R 1 ) ≥ I (V ; Z, S 1 , S 2 ) and H(S 1 , S 2 |Z) ≥ R k 1 + R k 2 then n (R k 1 +"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"I.
