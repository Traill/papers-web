Two-way data transfer takes place between the nodes A and B with the help of the relay R. It is assumed that all the three nodes operate in half-duplex mode, i.e., they cannot transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band. We consider the denoise-and-forward (DNF) protocol originally introduced in [1], which consists of the following two phases: the multiple access (MA) phase, during which A and B simultaneously transmit to R and the broadcast (BC) phase during which R transmits to A and B. Network coding map, which is also referred to as the denoising map, is chosen at R in such a way that A (B) can decode the messages of B (A), given that A (B) knows its own messages.\nThe idea of physical layer network coding for the two way relay channel was ﬁrst introduced in [2], where the multiple access interference occurring at the relay was exploited so\nthat the communication between the end nodes can be done using a two phase protocol. The design principles governing the choice of modulation schemes to be used at the nodes for uncoded transmission were studied in [3].\nIt was observed in [3] that for uncoded transmission, the network coding map used at the relay needs to be changed adaptively according to the channel fade coefﬁcient, in order to minimize the impact of the Multiple Access Interference (MAI). For the single antenna two-way relaying scenario, a computer search algorithm called the Closest-Neighbour Clustering (CNC) algorithm was proposed in [3] to obtain the adaptive network coding maps resulting in the best distance proﬁle at R. An alternative procedure to obtain the network coding maps, based on the removal of deep channel fade conditions using Latin Squares was proposed in [4]. A quanti- zation of the set of all possible channel realizations based on the network code used was obtained analytically in [5].\nThe CNC algorithm extended to the MIMO scenario in [6], is run for a given channel realization. The total number of network coding maps which would result is known only after the algorithm is run for all possible channel realizations which is uncountably inﬁnite. Hence, the number of overhead bits re- quired is not known beforehand. In this paper, it is shown that for the MIMO two-way relaying scenario, the MAI becomes severe when the row space of the channel fade coefﬁcient matrix is a subspace of a ﬁnite number of vector subspaces of C n A +n B referred to as the singular fade subspaces. The proposed scheme is based on the removal of singular fade subspaces. Since the number of such vector subspaces is ﬁnite, the number of overhead bits required is known beforehand. Also, for the proposed scheme, obtaining the network coding maps reduces to completing a ﬁnite number of partially ﬁlled Latin Rectangles, which avoids the problem of performing exhaustive search for an uncountably inﬁnite number of values.\nFor the SISO two-way relaying scenario, the effect of the MAI is totally captured by a single complex number which is the ratio of the channel fade coefﬁcients [3], [4]. In contrast, for the MIMO two-way relaying scenario, the deep channel fade conditions, which cannot be described by a single complex number, have an interesting vector subspace interpretation in terms of the singular fade subspaces.\nNotations: CN (0, σ 2 I n ) denotes the circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random vector of length n with covariance matrix σ 2 I n , where I n is the identity matrix of order n. The binary ﬁeld is denoted by F 2 . All the vector spaces and vector subspaces considered in this paper are over the complex ﬁeld\nC. Let span(c 1 , c 2 , . . . c L ) denote the vector space over C spanned by the complex vectors c 1 , c 2 , . . . c L ∈ C n . For a vector subspace V of C n , V ⊥ denotes the vector subspace {x : x T v = 0 ∀v ∈ V }. For a matrix H ∈ C m ×n , R(H) denotes the row space of H. The all zero vector of length n is denoted by 0 n . For a vector x of length n, x (i), 1 ≤ i ≤ n denotes the i th component of x. For vector subspaces V 1 and V 2 of C n , V 1 V 2 means that V 1 is a subspace of V 2 and V 1 V 2 means that V 1 is not a subspace of V 2 . By n A × n B system, we refer to the two-way relaying system with n A and n B antennas at the nodes A and B respectively, with no restriction placed on the number of antennas at the relay n R . For a vector x, x [i:j] , 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n denotes the vector obtained by taking only the i th to j th components of x. For a matrix A, A T denotes its transpose.\nIt is assumed that the complex numbers transmitted in each one of the antennas at the end nodes belong to the signal set S of size M = 2 λ , where λ is an integer. Assume that A (B) wants to transmit a λn A -bit (λn B -bit) binary tuple to B (A). At node A (B), the λn A (λn B ) bits are spatially multiplexed into n A (n B ) streams with each one of the streams consisting of λ bits. The λ bits in each one of the streams are mapped on to the signal set S using the map µ : F λ 2 → S and are transmitted.\nMultiple Access (MA) phase: Throughout, we assume a block fading scenario with the Channel State Informa- tion (CSI) available only at the receivers. Let x A = [µ(s A (1)), µ(s A (2)), ..., µ(s A (n A ))] T ∈ S n A , x B =\n[µ(s B (1)), µ(s B (2)), ..., µ(s B (n B ))] T ∈ S n B denote the complex vectors transmitted by A and B respectively, where s A (1), s A (2), ..., s A (n A ), s B (1), s B (2), ..., s B (n B ) ∈ F λ 2 . The received signal at R is given by Y R = H A x A + H B x B + Z R , where H A of size n R × n A and H B of size n R × n B are the channel matrices associated with the A-R and B-R links respectively. The additive noise vector Z R is assumed to be CN (0, σ 2 I n R ).\nLet S R (H A , H B ) ⊂ C n R denote the effective constellation seen at the relay during the MA phase, i.e.,\nLet d min (H A , H B ) denote the minimum distance between the points in the effective constellation S R (H A , H B ), i.e.,\nFrom (1), it is clear that there exists values of H A , H B for which d min (H A , H B ) = 0.\nLet ∆S denote the difference constellation of the signal set S, i.e., ∆S = {s i − s \u2032 i |s i , s \u2032 i ∈ S}. Let us deﬁne ∆x = [(x A − x \u2032 A ) T (x B − x \u2032 B ) T ] T ∈ ∆S n A +n B , where ∆x A = x A − x \u2032 A ∈ ∆S n A and ∆x B = x B − x \u2032 B ∈ ∆S n B , and H R = [H A H B ]. Also let H R = [h 1 h 2 ...h n R ] T , where the row vector h T k , 1 ≤ k ≤ n R of length n A + n B is the k th row of H R . From (1), it follows that,\nFrom (2) it follows that d 2 min (H A , H B ) = 0 if H R is such that h T k ∆x = 0, ∀1 ≤ k ≤ n R , for some ∆x ∈ ∆S n A +n B . Equivalently, for d 2 min (H A , H B ) = 0, the vectors h k , 1 ≤ k ≤ n R should belong to the vector subspace [span(∆x)] ⊥ for some ∆x ∈ ∆S n A +n B . In other words, the row space of H R should be a subspace of the vector subspace [span(∆x)] ⊥ , for some ∆x ∈ ∆S n A +n B , for d 2 min (H A , H B ) to become zero.\nThe channel fade coefﬁcient matrix H R is said to be a deep fade matrix , if d min (H A , H B ) = 0. The row space of the deep fade matrices are referred to as the deep fade spaces. The deep fade spaces are subspaces of the vector subspaces [span(∆x)] ⊥ , ∆x ∈ ∆S n A +n B , which are referred to as the singular fade subspaces . Let F denote the set of all singular fade subspaces, i.e., F = {[span(∆x)] ⊥ : ∆x ∈ ∆S n A +n B }. Note that singular fade subspaces depend only on the set {∆x : ∆x ∈ ∆S n A +n B }, i.e., they are independent of n R .\nBroadcast (BC) phase: Let (ˆ x A , ˆ x B ) ∈ S n A +n B denote the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimate of (x A , x B ) at R based on the received complex vector Y R , i.e.,\nDepending on H R , R chooses a many-to-one map M H R : S n A +n B → S \u2032 , where S \u2032 ⊂ C n R is the signal set (of size between max {M n A , M n B } and M n A +n B ) used by R during the BC phase. Note that |S \u2032 | should be at least max {M n A , M n B }, to transmit max{λn A , λn B } information bits. The elements in S n A +n B which are mapped on to the same complex vector in S \u2032 by the map M H R are said to form a cluster. Let {L 0 , L 2 , ..., L t −1 } denote the set of all such clusters. The formation of clusters for H R is called clustering, and is denoted by C H R . For simplicity, in the rest of the paper, the cluster L k is denoted by the subscript k, where 0 ≤ k ≤ t − 1.\nThe received signals at A and B during the BC phase are respectively given by,\nwhere X R = M H R (ˆ x A , ˆ x B ) ∈ S \u2032 is the complex vector transmitted by R. The fading matrices of size n A × n R and n B × n R corresponding to the R-A and R-B links are denoted by H \u2032 A and H \u2032 B respectively and the additive noises Z A and Z B are CN (0, σ 2 ).\nIn order to ensure that A (B) is able to decode B\u2019s (A\u2019s) messages, the clustering C H R should satisfy the exclusive law [3], i.e.,\nDeﬁnition 1: The cluster distance between a pair of clusters L i and L j is the minimum among all the distances calculated between the points H A x A + H B x B and H A x \u2032 A + H B x \u2032 B ∈ S R (H A , H B ), where (x A , x B ) ∈ L i and (x \u2032 A , x \u2032 B ) ∈ L j .\nThe minimum cluster distance of the clustering C H R is the minimum among all the cluster distances, i.e.,\nThe minimum cluster distance determines the performance during the MA phase of relaying. The performance during the BC phase is determined by the minimum distance of the signal set S \u2032 . For values of H R such that |h T k ∆x| is small, ∀1 ≤ k ≤ n R , for some ∆x ∈ ∆S n A +n B , d min (H R ) is greatly reduced, a phenomenon referred as distance shortening. To avoid distance shortening, for every singular fade subspace, a clustering needs to be chosen such that the minimum cluster distance at every H R whose rows belong to that singular fade subspace is non-zero.\nFor a singular fade subspace f ∈ F, let d min (C f , H R ) be deﬁned as,\nA clustering C f is said to remove a singular fade subspace f ∈ F, if the minimum cluster distance d min (C f , H R ) is greater than zero, for every H R such that R(H R ) f .\nIt is important to note that certain singular fade subspaces cannot be removed. These are precisely the singular fade subspaces which are of the form [span(∆x)] ⊥ , for which\nand are referred to as the non-removable singular fade sub- spaces. The reason for this is as follows: The pair (x A , x B ) and (x A , x \u2032 B ) result in ∆x = [0 T n A ∆x T B ] T . But (x A , x B ) and (x A , x \u2032 B ) cannot be placed in the same cluster since exclusive law will be violated.\nLet C F = C f : f ∈ F denote the set of all clusterings, which remove a removable singular fade subspace. For every removable singular fade subspace, the set C F contains exactly one clustering which removes that singular fade subspace.\nFor a given realization of H R , the clustering C H R is chosen to be C f , which satisﬁes d min (C f , H R ) ≥ d min (C f \u2032 , H R ), ∀f = f \u2032 ∈ F. The choice of C H R is indicated by R to A and B using overhead bits.\nThe contributions and organization of this paper are as follows.\n\u2022 The structure and the exact number of non-removable and removable singular fade subspaces for 2 λ − P SK signal set are obtained analytically (Section II).\n\u2022 It is shown that the requirement of satisfying the exclusive law is same as the clustering being represented by a partially ﬁlled Latin Rectangle (PFLR) and can be used to get the clustering which removes singular fade subspaces, by completing the PFLR (Section III A).\n\u2022 It is shown that the Latin Rectangles which remove the singular fade subspaces for the case when end nodes have unequal number of antennas, i.e., n A = n B can be obtained from the Latin Squares which remove the singular fade subspaces for the case when the nodes have\nequal number of antennas n = max{n A , n B }(Section III B).\n\u2022 For the n × n system, the singular fade subspaces which are removed by the conventional Exclusive-OR map are identiﬁed and it is shown that ﬁnding the network cod- ing maps which remove all the singular fade subspaces reduces to ﬁnding a small set of maps. (Section III C).\n\u2022 It is shown that most of the Latin Squares which remove the singular fade subspaces for the n × n system, n ≥ 2, are obtainable from Latin Squares of lower size (Section IV).\nThe proofs of Lemmas and other claims are omitted due to lack of space but are available in [8], with several illustrative examples.\nThe following lemma gives the total number of non- removable and removable singular fade subspaces for 2 λ -PSK signal set.\n\u2022 The total number of non-removable singular fade sub- spaces is given by,\n\u2022 The total number of removable singular fade subspaces is,\nExample 1: Consider the MIMO two-way relaying system with n A = 2 and n B = 2. From Lemma 1, the non-removable singular fade subspaces for BPSK and QPSK signal sets are respectively 4 and 28 in number. For BPSK and QPSK signal sets, the total number of removable singular fade subspaces are 32 and 1456 respectively. For examples of removable and non-removable singular fade subspaces, see [8].\nFrom Lemma 1, it can be seen that the number of non- removable singular fade subspaces is O (M 2 max{n A ,n B }−1 ), while the number of removable singular fade subspaces is O (M 2(n A +n B )−1 ). Hence, the number of non-removable sin- gular fade subspaces is a small fraction of the total number of singular fade subspaces and the fraction tends to zero for increasing values of M.\nIn this section, we establish the connection between Latin Rectangles and network coding maps satisfying the exclusive law, for the MIMO two-way relaying scenario.\nDeﬁnition 4: [7] A Latin Rectangle L of order N 1 × N 2 on the symbols from the set Z t = {0, 1, · · · , t − 1} is an N 1 × N 2 array, in which each cell contains one symbol and each symbol occurs at most once in each row and column. A Latin Rectangle of order N × N is called a Latin Square of order N.\nLet the points in the M -point signal set used for trans- mission at the nodes be indexed by the elements of the set Z M = {0, 1, 2, . . . , M − 1}. Consider an M n A × M n B array at the relay with the rows (columns) in- dexed by the n A -tuple(n B -tuple) [x A (1), x A (2), . . . , x A (n A )] ( [x B (1), x B (2), . . . , x B (n B )]) denoting the complex vector transmitted by node A (B). Our aim is to form clusters from the slots in the M n A × M n B array such that the exclusive law is satisﬁed. To do so, we will ﬁll in the slots in the array with the elements of set Z t and the clusters are obtained by taking all the row-column pairs (i, j), i ∈ Z n A M , j ∈ Z n B M such that the entry in the (i, j)−th slot is the same symbol from Z t for a cluster. Now, it is easy to see the following: For MIMO two-way relaying, every relay clustering which satisﬁes the exclusive law forms a Latin Rectangle and vice verse.\nA. Removing singular fade subspaces, Singularity-removal Constraints and Constrained Latin Rectangles\nConsider a singular fade subspace f ∈ F. Let (k, l)(k \u2032 , l \u2032 ) ∈ Z n A M × Z n B M be the pairs which result in ∆x such that [span(∆x)] ⊥ = f . If (k, l) and (k \u2032 , l \u2032 ) are not clustered together, the minimum cluster distance will be zero, for all H R such that R(H R ) f. To avoid this, those pairs should be in the same cluster. This requirement is termed as singularity- removal constraint . So, we need to obtain Latin Rectangles which can remove singular fade subspaces and with minimum value for t. Therefore, initially we will ﬁll the slots in the M n A × M n B array such that for the slots corresponding to a singularity-removal constraint the same element will be used to ﬁll slots. This removes that particular singular fade subspace. Such a partially ﬁlled Latin Rectangle is called a Constrained Partial Latin Rectangle (CPLR). After this, to make this a Latin Rectangle, we will try to ﬁll the other slots of the CPLR with minimum number of symbols from Z t .\nExample 2: Consider the 2 × 2 system with BPSK signal set {±1} used at the end nodes. For the singular fade subspace [span([0, −2, −2, 2] T )] ⊥ , the \t singularity \t removal \t constraints \t are {{([0 0] , [0 1]) , ([0 1] , [1 0])} , {([1 0] , [0 1]) , ([1 1] , [1 0])}} . The ﬁlled Latin Square which removes this singular fade subspace is shown in Fig. 2.\nWithout loss of generality, assume n B > n A . If [span([∆x T A ∆x T B ] T )] ⊥ is a singular fade subspace for\nthe n A × n B system, then [span([0 T n B −n A ∆x T A ∆x T B ] T )] ⊥ is a singular fade subspace for the n B × n B system. For a Latin Square L of order n, let L [1:r,:] denote the Latin Rectangle of order r × n obtained by taking only the ﬁrst r rows of L.\nLemma 2: For n B > n A , if the Latin Square L removes [span([0 T n B −n A ∆x T A ∆x T B ] T )] ⊥ for the n B × n B system, the Latin Rectangle L [1:M nA , :] removes [span([∆x T A ∆x T B ] T )] ⊥ for the n A × n B system.\nExample 3: The Latin Rectangle obtained by taking only the ﬁrst two rows of the Latin Square in Fig. 2 which re- moves [span([0, −2, −2, 2] T )] ⊥ for the 2 × 2 system, removes [span([−2, −2, 2] T )] ⊥ for the 1 × 2 system, with BPSK signal set.\nSince the Latin Rectangles for the n A × n B system are obtainable from Latin Squares, in the rest of the paper it is assumed that n A = n B = n.\nRecall that the rows and columns of the Latin Squares are indexed by vectors which belong to Z n M . By bit-wise XOR of two such vectors, it is meant to be the vector obtained by taking the bit-wise XOR of the individual components of the two vectors, after decimal to binary conversion. Every cell in the Latin Square corresponding to the bit-wise XOR mapping is ﬁlled with the decimal equivalent of the bit-wise XOR of the row index and the column index.\nConsider the set of singular fade subspaces [span([∆x T A ∆x T B ] T )] ⊥ , denoted by F ± , which satisfy the condition that ∆x A (i) = ±∆x B (i), ∀1 ≤ i ≤ n.\nLemma 3: When the user nodes use 2 λ -PSK constellations, all the singular fade subspaces which belong to the set F ± are removed by bit-wise XOR mapping, for all λ.\nExample 4: For the 2 × 2 system with BPSK signal set, [span([2, −2, 2, 2] T )] ⊥ ∈ F ± and is removed by the bit-wise XOR mapping given in Fig. 3.\nDeﬁnition 2: A Latin Square L T is said to be the Transpose of a Latin Square L, if L T (i, j) = L(j, i) for all i, j ∈ {0, 1, 2, .., M − 1}.\nLemma 4: If \t the \t Latin \t Square \t L \t removes [span([∆x T A ∆x T B )] T ] ⊥ , then the Latin Square L T removes [span([∆x T B ∆x T A )] T ] ⊥ .\nDeﬁnition 3: [7] Two Latin Squares L and L \u2032 (using the same symbol set) are isotopic if there is a triple (f,g,h), where f is a row permutation, g is a column permutation and h is a symbol permutation, such that applying these permutations on L gives L \u2032 .\nConsider a vector ∆˜ x = [∆˜ x T A ∆˜ x T B ] T , where ∆˜ x A and ∆˜ x B are obtained by the applying the permutations σ A and σ B on the components of ∆x A and ∆x B respectively. Equivalently this can be viewed as applying the permutations σ A and σ B on the indices of the transmitting antennas at A and B respectively. Hence, we have the following lemma.\nLemma 5: If a Latin Square L removes [span(∆x)] ⊥ , the isotopic Latin Square L \u2032 obtained by applying the permutation σ A on the components of the row indices and the permutation σ B on the components of the column indices of L removes [span(∆˜ x )] ⊥ .\nFor 2 λ -PSK signal set, consider two singular fade subspaces [span(∆x)] ⊥ and [span(∆¯ x )] ⊥ which are such that the abso- lute values of the components of ∆x and ∆¯ x are equal. Let [φ T A φ T B ] T and [φ \u2032T A φ \u2032T B ] T be the vectors consisting of the phases of individual components of ∆x and ∆¯ x respectively. Let ∆φ A = φ A − φ \u2032 A and ∆φ B = φ B − φ \u2032 B . Also let ∆φ A (i) = k Ai 2π M and ∆φ B (i) = k Bi 2π M .\nLemma 6: For 2 λ -PSK signal set, let L denote the Latin Square which removes the singular fade subspace [span(∆x)] ⊥ . The Latin Square L \u2032 which removes the singular fade subspace [span(∆¯ x )] ⊥ can be obtained from L as follows: To the i th component of all the row indices of L add k A i modulo M ∀1 ≤ i ≤ n and to the i th component of all the column indices of L add k B i modulo M ∀1 ≤ i ≤ n, to obtain the Latin Square L \u2032 .\nThe usefulness of Lemmas 4-6 is that the set of all Latin Squares which remove all the singular fade subspaces can be obtained from a small set of Latin Squares, as illustrated for the 2 × 2 system in [8].\nIn this section, it is shown that most of the Latin Squares which remove the singular fade subspaces of the n ×n system, n ≥ 2 are obtainable from the Latin Squares which remove the singular fade subspaces of m × m system, where m < n.\nDeﬁnition 4: For two vectors y and z of length 2a and 2b respectively, the compound vector of y and z, denoted as comp(y, z) is the vector of length 2a + 2b given by\nFor a Latin Square L, let L [i:j,k:l] denote the (j − i + 1) × (l − k + 1) array obtained by taking only the i th to j th rows and k th to l th columns of L. Let L +c denote the Latin Square obtained by adding integer c to all the cells of L. Let max{L} denote the maximum among all the integers ﬁlled in the cells of the Latin Square L.\nDeﬁnition 5: The Cartesian product of the two Latin Squares L 1 of order M a and L 2 of order M b , denoted as (L 1 ⊗ L 2 ), is the Latin Square of order M a +b for which\nFor example illustrating the notion of Cartesian product of Latin Squares, see [8].\nLemma 7: Let L 1 and L 2 respectively denote the Latin Squares of order M a × M a and M b × M b , which remove the singular fade subspaces [span(∆x 1 )] ⊥ of the a × a system, and [span(∆x 2 )] ⊥ of the b × b system. The Latin Square L 1 ⊗ L 2 removes all the singular fade subspaces of the form [span(comp(∆x 1 , k ∆x 2 ))] ⊥ , k ∈ C, for the (a + b) × (a + b) system.\nSimulation results presented are for QPSK and n A = n B = n R = 2. As a reference scheme, we consider the case when\nbit-wise XOR network code is used at R, irrespective of the channel conditions.\nThe additive noises at the nodes are taken to be of unit variance and energy of the signal set used at the nodes, which is assumed to be equal, is deﬁned to be the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Fig. 4 shows the SNR vs BER performance for the proposed scheme and the pure XOR network code, for the case when each one of the entries of the matrices H A , H B , H \u2032 A and H \u2032 B follow i.i.d. Rayleigh distribution, with unit variance and also when each one of the entries of the matrices H A , H B , H \u2032 A and H \u2032 B follow i.i.d. Rician distribution with a Rician Factor of 10 dB and unit variances. From Fig. 4, it can be seen that for the Rayleigh and Rician fading scenarios considered, at a BER of 10 −4 , the proposed scheme provides a gain of 1.5 dB and 2.5 dB respectively over the pure XOR network code."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"P.
