As its direct application, we propose a new secret sharing scheme similar to Shamir\u2019s secret sharing scheme.\nAs we know, Lagrange interpolation formula in ﬁnite ﬁelds has close relationship with Reed-Solomon codes over ﬁnite ﬁelds and their generalizations, which are very useful in practice [8], [12], [17]. In the other hand, many results are about cyclic codes over rings such as integer residue rings, chain rings and p-adic rings [3], [4], [13], [14] and about quasi- cyclic codes [5], [6], [9], [10], [11]. In [7] authors viewed quasi-cyclic codes over a ﬁnite ﬁeld as cyclic codes over rings of matrices and proposed a new construction of some quasi- cyclic codes and self-dual codes.\nIn this paper we also introduce the generalized Reed- Solomon codes over a noncommutative ring of matrices over a ﬁnite ﬁeld and study their properties using this interpolation formula. We show that they are maximum distance separable (MDS) and present the key equation by deriving their dual codes and Goppa formulation.\nLet F q be a ﬁnite ﬁeld where q is a prime power and let M m ( F q ) denote the noncommutative ring of m × m matrices with entries in F q and M m ( F q )[X] denote the polynomials ring with coefﬁcients from M m ( F q ). In addition, we denote\nm × m zero matrix and the m × m identity matrix by 0 m and I m , respectively.\nAny polynomial with coefﬁcients over ﬁnite ﬁelds of degree less than n is uniquely determined by its values at n (or more) distinct points. This is the famous Lagrange interpolation polynomials in ﬁnite ﬁelds [15].\nNow we generalize the famous formula. First through- out this paper let n be a positive integer and let A = {A 1 , · · · , A n } be a subset of M m ( F q ) such that for any i ̸= j, A i − A j is invertible and A i A j = A j A i . For example,\n 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0\nThen {I m , A, A 2 , · · · , A 6 } is a subset satisfying the above condition. In addition we suppose that the indeterminate X can commute with any matrix in M m ( F q ).\nTheorem 1: Let A be deﬁned as above. Then there exists a unique polynomial f (X) with degree less that n, i.e.,\nProof: First it is obvious that f (X) satisﬁes (1) with degree less than n. Assume g(X) ∈ M m ( F q )[X] also satisﬁes (1) and its degree is less than n.\nWithout the loss of generality, we assume the degree of f (X) −g(X) is n−1. The Euclidean division of f(X)−g(X) by X − A 1 , which is possible because X − A 1 is monic, is\nSince f (A 1 ) − g(A 1 ) = 0 m , we have r 1 (X) = 0 m . For i = 2, · · · , n, we get q 1 (A i ) = 0 m since f (A i ) − g(A i ) = 0 m and A i − A 1 is invertible.\nBased on the above theorem, we can construct a new secret sharing scheme similar to Shamir\u2019s secret sharing scheme.\nTheorem 2: Let A be deﬁned as above and an integer k, 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Let a secret data D ∈ M m ( F q ). Randomly choose k − 1 elements C 1 , · · · , C k −1 ∈ M m ( F q ) and one can get a polynomial\nThen the set {D 1 , . . . , D n } is a (k, n)-threshold secret sharing scheme.\nThe proof is immediate result of Theorem 1 and so is omitted here.\nIn this paper we take M m ( F q ) as a code alphabet. Let M m ( F q ) n denote the set of all n-tuples whose components are from M m ( F q ), which can be regarded as a free module. A linear code over M m ( F q ) is a submodule of M m ( F q ) n .\nSimilar to the deﬁnition in ﬁnite ﬁeld case, we can deﬁne the Hamming weight and Hamming distance.\nDeﬁnition 1: Let u ∈ M m ( F q ) n . The Hamming weight of u, denoted by wt(u), is deﬁned to be the number of nonzero components of u. The Hamming distance between u and v, denoted by d(u, v), is wt(u − v).\nLet C be a code of length n over M m ( F q ). The code C is cyclic if (c n , c 1 , . . . , c n −1 ) is also in C for any c = (c 1 , . . . , c n ) ∈ C. The minimum distance of C , denoted by d(C), is deﬁned as\nLet A be deﬁned as above and V = {V 1 , . . . , V n } be a subset of M m ( F q ) such that V i is invertible for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. For example, we can take V = {I m , . . . , I m }.\nDeﬁnition 2: For k, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, we deﬁne the generalized Reed-Solomon codes over rings of matrices M m ( F q ) by\nwhere M m ( F q )[X] k denotes the set of all polynomials in M m ( F q )[X] of degree less than k.\nTheorem 3: The generalized Reed-Solomon code GRS n,k (A, V) is a cyclic code with parameters [n, k, n − k + 1], so it is an MDS code.\nProof: It is obvious that GRS n,k (A, V) has length n and dimension k.\nSecondly, if (V 1 f (A 1 ), . . . , V n f (A n )) is in GRS n,k (A, V), by Theorem 1 there exists a unique polynomial g(X) with degree less than k such that g(A 1 ) = V −1 1 V n f (A n ) and\ng(A i ) = V −1 i V i −1 f (A i −1 ) for 2 ≤ i ≤ n. Hence the code is cyclic.\nLet f (X) and g(X) be distinct polynomials in M m ( F q )[X] k . Set h(X) = f (X) − g(X), and so h(X) ̸= 0 is also of degree less than k and let t be the number of the roots that h(X) has among {A 1 , · · · , A n }. The weight of codeword generated by h(X) must be no less than n − t. By Theorem 1 we get t ≤ k − 1 and so the minimum distance must be no less than n − k + 1. Let h(X) =\nand we can get a codeword of weight n − k + 1. Therefore the result is required.\nAs special linear codes, quasi-cyclic codes are the nat- ural generalization of cyclic codes. A linear code C of length n is called a quasi-cyclic code with index ℓ over F q if (c n −ℓ+1 , . . . , c n , c 1 , . . . , c n −ℓ ) ∈ C, for any c = (c 1 , . . . , c n ) ∈ C. It is well known that ℓ divides n and so we write n = mℓ. It is clear that C is cyclic if ℓ = 1.\nLet C be a linear code over M m ( F q ) and c = (c 1 , . . . , c n ) ∈ C. So we also can regard c as a codeword over F q if it is written as\nc = (c (1,1) 1 , · · · , c (1,m) 1 , c (2,1) 1 , · · · , c (2,m) 1 , · · · , c (m,m) 1 \t , · · · , · · ·\nwhere c (i,j) l denotes the (i, j)th entry of c l for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m and 1 ≤ l ≤ n.\nCorollary 1: The generalized Reed-Solomon code GRS m,k (A, V) over M m ( F q ) is quasi-cyclic code over F q with index m 2 and its minimum distance is at least nm 2 − km 2 + m 2 .\nThe proof is forward result of Theorem 3 and is omitted here. Let y = (y 1 , . . . , y n ) and x = (x 1 , . . . , x n ) in M m ( F q ) n .\ny i x i . If C is an [n, k] linear code over M m ( F q ), its left dual code\nTheorem 4: If V further satisﬁes that V i B = BV i for any B ∈ M m ( F q ) and all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, the left dual of GRS n,k (A, V) is ⊥ GRS n,k (A, V) = GRS n,n −k (A, U),\n(A i − A j ) −1 . Proof: We need to prove that\nfor any f (X) ∈ M m ( F q )[X] k and g(X) ∈ M m ( F q )[X] n −k . So their product g(X)f (X) has degree at most n − 2. By Theorem 1, we have\nEquation the coefﬁcient of X n −1 from the two sides gives (3) and so the result is obtained.\nSet r = n − k. Let c = (c 1 , . . . , c n ) ∈ M m ( F q ) n and V satisfy the condition in Theorem 4. Then\nWe rewrite these r equations as a single equation in the polynomial ring M m ( F q )[Z] in a new indeterminate Z. The vector c is in C if and only if in M m ( F q )[Z] we have\nwe get the Goppa formulation for the generalized Reed- Solomon code GRS n,k (A, V) over M m ( F q ).\nTheorem 5: Let V satisfy the condition in Theorem 4. The generalized Reed-Solomon codes GRS n,k (A, V) over M m ( F q ) is equal to the set of all n-tuples c = (c 1 , · · · , c n ) with c i ∈ M m ( F q ) such that\nOnce we have Goppa formulation for for the generalized Reed-Solomon code GRS n,k (A, V) over M m ( F q ) and we suppose that the subset A satisﬁes that A i B = BA i for all B ∈ M m ( F q ), it is easy to get the key equation.\nSuppose c = (c 1 , . . . , c n ) is a transmitted codeword, r = (r 1 , . . . , r n ) is the received word and e = (e 1 , . . . , e n ) is the error pattern. So we have r = c + e. Calculate the syndrome polynomial of r:\nLet B = {i| e i ̸= 0} be the set of error locations. Then we have the syndrome polynomial\nNow we drop the subscripts and write S(Z) for the syn- drome polynomial.\nDecoding problem can be reduced to matrix feedback shift register synthesis problem. In [16] such a algorithm has been given and so studying decoding problem is our future work.\nThe research was supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 10990011 and No. 61170289) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant XDA06010702.
