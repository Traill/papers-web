It has shown that characterizing the solvability of a general non-multicast network is a difﬁcult task [2]. The multiple-unicast problem is of great interest for non-multicast network coding studies [3], [4]. Dougherty and Zeger proved that any ﬁnite directed acyclic network is CSLS-equivalent to a multiple-unicast network [5]. Some outer bounds on the achievable rate-region for the multiple-unicast problem were presented in [6], [7]. However, it remains open to give an exact characterization for the solvability of general multiple-unicast problems except the two-unicast case with rate (1,1)[8],[9].\nIn this paper, we consider the two-unicast network coding problem with rate (1,2), i.e., one source (s 1 ) wishes to commu- nicate a message X 1 to one sink (t 1 ) and the other source (s 2 ) wishes to communicate two messages X 2 and X 3 to another sink (t 2 ). We give a necessary and sufﬁcient condition on the linear solvability under the condition that the maximum ﬂow from {s 1 , s 2 } to t 2 is 3. To this end, we develop a region decomposition approach in the spirt of the information ﬂow decomposition approach proposed by C. Fragouli and E. Soljanin [10]. We believe that the region decomposition approach can be a useful method for non-multicast network coding problem [9].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we intro- duce the basic notion and the region decomposition method. In Section III, the region decomposition method is further developed. The main result is presented in Section IV, and the paper is concluded in Section V.\nConsider a communication network modeled as a ﬁnite, directed, acyclic graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of\nnodes and E is the set of links. In this work, we assume that G is a two-unicast network with rate (1,2), i.e., G has two source-sink pairs {s 1 , t 1 } and {s 2 , t 2 }. The source s 1 wishes to communicate a message X 1 to the sink t 1 and the source s 2 wishes to communicate two messages X 2 and X 3 to the sink t 2 , where X i , i = 1, 2, 3, are independent random variables taking values from a ﬁxed ﬁnite ﬁeld F. A link e = (u, v) can transmit one symbol, i.e., one element of the ﬁeld F, from node u to v per transmission.\nAs in [1], we assume that the source s 1 has one virtual incoming link, called the X 1 source link, and the source s 2 has two virtual incoming links, called the X 2 source link and X 3 source link respectively. Correspondingly, the sink t 1 has a virtual outgoing link, called the X 1 sink link and the sink t 2 has two virtual outgoing links, called the X 2 sink link and X 3 sink link respectively. A link e is called a source (sink) link if it is a virtual incoming (outgoing) link of the sources (sinks). If e is not a source link, we call e a non-source link.\nFor a link e = (u, v), u is called the tail of e and v is called the head of e, and are denoted by u = tail(e) and v = head(e), respectively. For two links e, e \u2032 ∈ E, we call e \u2032 an incoming link of e (e an outgoing link of e \u2032 ) if tail(e) = head(e \u2032 ). For any e ∈ E, denoted by In(e) the set of incoming links of e. We assume that In(e) ̸= ∅ if e ∈ E is not the source link. Otherwise, e has no impact on the network communication and can be removed from G. Note that G = (V, E) is acyclic, in this paper, we always assume that E is sequentially indexed as E = {e 1 , e 2 , e 3 , · · · , e |E| } such that e i is the X i source link, i = 1, 2, 3 and i < j if e i is an incoming link of e j .\nLet A, B ⊆ V and S ⊆ E. S is called an A-B cut if there is no directed path from any vertex in A to any vertex in B in the graph G \\ S. Deﬁne the mincut from A to B by c(A; B) := min {|S|; S is an A-B cut}, where |S| is the size of S. For v 1 , v 2 ∈ V , we denote v 1 → v 2 if there is a path in G from v 1 to v 2 . Else, we denote v 1 v 2 .\nFor i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, denote α i the vector of F 3 with the ith component being 1 and all the other components being 0. For Ψ ⊆ F 3 , denote ⟨Ψ⟩ the subspace of F 3 spanned by Ψ.\nDeﬁnition 2.1 (Linear Network Code [1]): A linear net- work code (LNC) of G over the ﬁnite ﬁeld F is a collection of vectors C = {d e ∈ F 3 ; e ∈ E \u2032 } such that\n(1) If e is the X i source link or the X i sink link (i ∈ {1, 2, 3}), then d e = α i ;\nThe vector d e is called the global encoding vector of e. G is said to be linearly solvable if G has a linear network code over some ﬁnite ﬁeld F.\nDeﬁnition 2.2 (Region Decomposition): Let R be a non- empty subset of E. R is called a region of G if there is a e 0 ∈ R such that any e ∈ R \\ {e 0 } has an incoming link in R. Meanwhile, e 0 is called the head of R and is denoted by e 0 = head(R). If E is partitioned into mutually disjoint regions, say R 1 , · · · , R n , we call D = {R 1 , · · · , R n } a region decomposition of G.\nLet D be a region decomposition of G and R ∈ D. For i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, R is called the X i source region if head(R) is the X i source link; R is called the X i sink region if R contains the X i sink link; R is called an X i region if R is the X i source region or the X i sink region. R is called a singular region if R is both an X i region and an X j region for some i ̸= j. D is called a singular region decomposition if it contains a singular region; otherwise, it is called nonsingular.\nConvention: All the X i source (sink) regions are called source (sink) regions. The other regions are called coding regions. The terminology non-source region refers to a region which is not a source region.\nLet D be a region decomposition of G and {R, R \u2032 } ⊆ D. We say that R \u2032 is a parent of R (R a child of R \u2032 ) if In(head(R)) ∩ R \u2032 ̸= ∅, i.e., head(R) has an incoming link in R \u2032 . Denoted by In(R) the set of parents of R.\nDeﬁnition 2.3 (Region Graph): Let D be a region decom- position of G. The region graph with respect to D, denoted by RG(D), is a directed, simple graph with vertex set D and edge set {(R \u2032 , R) ∈ D 2 ; R \u2032 is a parent of R }.\nSince G is acyclic, it is easy to see that RG(D) is a- cyclic. A path from R 0 to R k , denoted l R 0 →R k is a subset {R 0 , R 1 , · · · , R k } ⊆ D such that R i −1 is a parent of R i . For R, Q ∈ D, we denote R → Q if there is a path from R to Q. Else, we denote R Q.\nDeﬁnition 2.4 (Codes on Region Graph): Let D be a non- singular region decomposition of G. A linear network code (LNC) of RG(D) over the ﬁnite ﬁeld F is a collection of vectors ¯ C = {d R ∈ F 3 ; R ∈ D} such that\n(2) If R is a non-source region, then d R ∈ ⟨{d P ; P ∈ In(R) }⟩.\nThe vector d R is called the global encoding vector of R. The region graph RG(D) is said to be linearly solvable if it has a linear network code over some ﬁnite ﬁeld F.\nClearly, an LNC of RG(D) can be extended to an LNC of G. Thus if RG(D) is linearly solvable then the original network G is linearly solvable.\nAs in [9], we have an O( |E|) time algorithm (See Fig. 2) to obtain a special region decomposition, namely D 1 of G such that G is linearly solvable if and only if RG(D 1 ) is linearly solvable and each non-source region has at least two parents. In what follows, we will always use D 1 to denote the region decomposition obtained by algorithm 1.\nExample 2.5: By Algorithm 1, we can decompose the net- work G 1 in Fig. 1 with R 1 = {e 1 , (s 1 , v 3 ), (s 1 , v 7 ), (s 1 , v 10 ) }, R 2 = {e 2 }, R 3 = {e 3 }, R 4 = {(s 2 , v 1 ), (v 1 , v 3 ), (v 1 , v 4 ) }, R 5 = {(s 2 , v 2 ), (v 2 , v 4 ) }, R 6 = {(v 3 , v 5 ), (v 5 , v 7 ), (v 5 , v 11 ) }, R 7 = {(v 4 , v 6 ), (v 6 , v 9 ), (v 6 , v 11 ) }, R 8 = {(v 7 , v 8 ), (v 8 , v 9 ), (v 8 , t 2 ) }, R 9 = {(v 9 , t 1 ), (t 1 , v 10 ), (t 1 , v 11 ), (t 1 , t 2 ), e 4 }, R 10 = {(v 10 , v 11 ) }, R 11 = {(v 11 , t 2 ) }, R 12 = {e 5 }, R 13 = {e 6 }. Then D 1 = {R 1 , · · · , R 13 } is a nonsingular region decomposition of G 1 , where R 1 , R 2 , R 3 are the X 1 , X 2 , X 3 source region and R 9 , R 12 , R 13 are the X 1 , X 2 , X 3 sink region respectively. The region graph RG(D 1 ) is shown in Fig. 3.\nThe region decomposition method can be used to character- ize the solvability of 2-simple multicast networks [9]. Howev- er, to characterize the solvability of the 2-unicast network with rate (1,2), further development of the region decomposition method is need. First, we give the following deﬁnitions.\nDeﬁnition 3.1 (Super Region): Let ∅ ̸= Θ ⊆ D. The super region generated by Θ, is a subset reg(Θ) of D satisﬁes:\nSince RG(D) is acyclic, reg(Θ) is well deﬁned. Denote reg ◦ (Θ) = reg(Θ) \\ Θ, and reg(Θ) = reg(R 1 , · · · , R k ) if Θ = {R 1 , · · · , R k }.\nDeﬁnition 3.2 (2-dimensional Region): Let {R 1 , R 2 } ⊆ D and reg ◦ (R 1 , R 2 ) ̸= ∅. reg(R 1 , R 2 ) is called a 2-dimensional region of RG(D) if for any {Q 1 , Q 2 } ⊆ D, reg(R 1 , R 2 ) ⊆ reg(Q 1 , Q 2 ) implies {R 1 , R 2 } = {Q 1 , Q 2 }.\nConvention: To differentiate with the general super re- gions, in the following, we denote a 2-dimensional region reg(R 1 , R 2 ) as Π R 1 ,R 2 and meanwhile denote reg ◦ (R 1 , R 2 ) as Π ◦ R\nWe can use the algorithm in Fig. 4 to ﬁnd out all 2- dimensional regions for any region decomposition D.\nReconsider Example 2.5. By algorithm 2, we can see that Π R 2 ,R 3 = {R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 7 }, Π R 1 ,R 4 = {R 1 , R 4 , R 6 , R 8 }, Π R 7 ,R 8 = {R 7 , R 8 , R 9 }, and Π R 1 ,R 9 = {R 1 , R 9 , R 10 }\nTheorem 3.3: Let D be a region decomposition of G such that each non-source region has at least 2 parents. If R 1 , R 2 , Q 1 , Q 2 ∈ D such that |reg(R 1 , R 2 ) ∩ reg(Q 1 , Q 2 ) | ≥ 2, then either reg(R 1 , R 2 ) ⊆ reg(Q 1 , Q 2 ) or reg(Q 1 , Q 2 ) ⊆ reg(R 1 , R 2 ).\nStep 1: We prove that there exist W 1 , W 2 ∈ D such that {W 1 , W 2 } ⊆ reg(R 1 , R 2 ) ∩ reg(Q 1 , Q 2 ) and W 1 , W 2 / ∈ reg ◦ (R 1 , R 2 ) ∩ reg ◦ (Q 1 , Q 2 ). Consider the following two cases:\nCase 2: reg ◦ (R 1 , R 2 ) ∩ reg ◦ (Q 1 , Q 2 ) ̸= ∅. Since RG(D) is ﬁnite, there exists at least one region, say W , in reg ◦ (R 1 , R 2 ) ∩reg ◦ (Q 1 , Q 2 ) such that no parent of W belongs to reg ◦ (R 1 , R 2 ) ∩ reg ◦ (Q 1 , Q 2 ). Let {W 1 , W 2 } ⊆ In(W ). Then {W 1 , W 2 } ⊆ reg(R 1 , R 2 ) ∩ reg(Q 1 , Q 2 ) and W 1 , W 2 / ∈ reg ◦ (R 1 , R 2 ) ∩ reg ◦ (Q 1 , Q 2 ).\nStep 2: We prove that reg(R 1 , R 2 ) ⊆ reg(Q 1 , Q 2 ) or reg(Q 1 , Q 2 ) ⊆ reg(R 1 , R 2 ). In step 1, we have proven that there are two regions W 1 , W 2 such that {W 1 , W 2 } ⊆ reg(R 1 , R 2 ) ∩ reg(Q 1 , Q 2 ) and W 1 , W 2 / ∈ reg ◦ (R 1 , R 2 ) ∩ reg ◦ (Q 1 , Q 2 ). We have the following three cases.\nCase 1: {W 1 , W 2 } = {R 1 , R 2 }. For this case, reg(R 1 , R 2 ) ⊆ reg(Q 1 , Q 2 ).\nCase 2: {W 1 , W 2 } = {Q 1 , Q 2 }. For this case, reg(Q 1 , Q 2 ) ⊆ reg(R 1 , R 2 ).\nCase 3: W 1 ∈ {R 1 , R 2 } ∩ reg ◦ (Q 1 , Q 2 ) and W 2 ∈ {Q 1 , Q 2 } ∩ reg ◦ (R 1 , R 2 ). Since each non-source region has at least 2 parents, by Deﬁnition 3.1, we can easily ﬁnd a path from W 1 to W 2 and a path from W 2 to W 1 , which contradicts to the fact that RG(D) is acyclic.\nCorollary 3.4: For any two different 2-dimensional regions Π R 1 ,R 2 and Π Q 1 ,Q 2 , |Π R 1 ,R 2 ∩ Π Q 1 ,Q 2 | ≤ 1.\nCorollary 3.5: Let |In(R)| = 2. Then there exists an unique 2-dimensional region Π U 1 ,U 2 such that R ∈ Π ◦ U 1 ,U 2 .\nTheorem 3.3, Corollary 3.4 and Corollary 3.5 establish the basic properties of the super regions of a region graph. (In fact, we have developed more relations on the super regions, due to the space limitation, we omit them.)\nIn this section, we ﬁrst construct a special region graph NRG(D ∗ ), called the normal region graph of G, such that G is linearly solvable if and only if NRG(D ∗ ) is linearly solvable. Then we characterize the linear solvability of G by NRG(D ∗ ).\nThe construction process of NRG(D ∗ ) is as follows: Step 1: Generate D 1 by Algorithm 1.\nBy Algorithm 1, we can see that D 1 satisﬁes: each non- source region has at least 2 parents. To get NRG(D ∗ ), we need more operations on RG(D 1 ). Note that by deﬁnition of regions, a parent and a child can always be combined together to form a new region. We can have the following lemma.\nLemma 4.1: Suppose {R 1 , R 2 } ⊆ D 1 such that reg ◦ (R 1 , R 2 ) ̸= ∅. Let R \u2032 1 = R 1 ∪ reg ◦ (R 1 , R 2 ) and D \u2032 = D 1 ∪ {R \u2032 1 } \\ ({R 1 } ∪ reg ◦ (R 1 , R 2 )). Then D \u2032 is a region decomposition of G.\nLet S \u2032 1 and T 1 denote the X 1 source region and X 1 sink region respectively. If reg ◦ (S \u2032 1 , T 1 ) ̸= ∅, let S 1 = S \u2032 1 ∪ reg ◦ (S \u2032 1 , T 1 ) and D 2 = D 1 ∪ {S 1 } \\ ({S \u2032 1 } ∪ reg ◦ (S \u2032 1 , T 1 )). Else, let D 2 = D 1 and S 1 = S \u2032 1 . By Lemma 4.1, D 2 is a region decomposition of G. Clearly, D 2 satisﬁes: (1) each non-source region has at least 2 parents; (2) S 1 is the X 1 source region and reg ◦ (S 1 , T 1 ) = ∅.\nConsider D 1 of network G 1 in Example 2.5. We have S \u2032 1 = R 1 , T 1 = R 9 and reg ◦ (S \u2032 1 , T 1 ) = {R 10 }, then D 2 = {R 1 ∪ R 10 , R 2 , · · · , R 9 , R 11 , · · · , R 13 } is still a region decomposition of G 1 and S 1 = R 1 ∪ R 10 is the X 1 source region of D 2 .\nThe region graph NRG(D ∗ ) can be obtained from RG(D 2 ) by the following three steps.\nStep 3.1: If there is an R ∈ D 2 such that R is a common child of S 1 and T 1 , then delete the edge (T 1 , R). Repeat this operation until S 1 and T 1 have no common child.\nStep 3.2: If R is a child of T 1 , then delete edge (T 1 , R) and add a new edge (S 1 , R) to RG(D 2 ). Repeat this operation until T 1 has no child.\nStep 3.3: If there is a coding region R which has more than 2 parents, say P 1 , · · · , P k , then delete edges (P i , R), i = 1, · · · , k − 1 and add k − 2 extra regions Q R,1 , · · · , Q R,k −2 and new edges (P 1 , Q R,1 ), (P 2 , Q R,1 ), (Q R,i −1 , Q R,i ), (P i+1 , Q R,i )(i = 2, · · · , k − 2) and (Q R,k −2 , R). Repeat this operation until each coding region has exactly two parents.\nBy the above process, we get NRG(D ∗ ), the normal region graph, of G, where D ∗ is the corresponded vertex set. Fig. 5 is the normal region graph of G 1 in Example 2.5.\nClearly, NRG(D ∗ ) is a simple, acyclic graph and satisﬁes: (1) the sink regions have no child; (2) each coding region has exactly 2 parents; and (3) In(T 2 ) = In(T 3 ).\nTheorem 4.2: G is linearly solvable if and only if NRG(D ∗ ) is linearly solvable.\nProof: Suppose {d R ; R ∈ D ∗ } is an LNC of NRG(D ∗ ). By the construction of NRG(D ∗ ), {d R ; R ∈ D 2 } is an LNC\nof RG(D 2 ). Let C = {d e ; e ∈ E, d e = d R if e ∈ R}, then C is an LNC of G.\nConversely, suppose C is an LNC of G. According to Algorithm 1 and as in [9], it is easy to see that there exists an LNC {d R ; R ∈ D 1 } of RG(D 1 ) such that d R = d head(R) . For RG(D 2 ), let d S 1 = α 1 and keep the rest encoding vectors as in RG(D 1 ). Then obviously, {d R ; R ∈ D 2 } is an LNC of RG(D 2 ). In step 3.3, if d R =\nλ i d P i (k ≥ 3), then let d Q R,i =\nλ j d P j and keep the other encoding vectors as in RG(D 2 ); and we obtain an LNC of NRG(D ∗ ), which complete the proof.\nWe now give a sufﬁcient and necessary condition on the lin- ear solvability of the 2-unicast networks with c( {s 1 , s 2 }, t 2 ) = 3 by analyzing the 2-dimensional regions of NRG(D ∗ ). Since the detailed proof is complicated, we just show the sketch of the proof here.\nWe suppose the considered network satisﬁes the following two conditions:\nA1: c( {s 1 }; {t 1 }) ≥ 1, c({s 2 }; {t 2 }) ≥ 2, s 1 → t 2 and s 2 → t 1 .\nA2: If {e 1 , e 2 } is an {s 1 , s 2 }-{t 1 } cut, then it is not an {s 2 }-{t 2 } cut.\nWe note that A1 is natural because if c( {s 1 }; {t 1 }) < 1 or c( {s 2 }; {t 2 }) < 2, then the network is unsolvable obviously. If s 2 t 1 or s 1 t 2 , the network becomes two independent unicast network and it is trivial to determine its solvability. A2 is also natural because for a solvable network, {e 1 , e 2 } is an {s 1 , s 2 } − {t 1 } means that α 1 ∈ ⟨d e 1 , d e 2 ⟩. It is an {s 2 }-{t 2 } cut means that α 2 , α 3 ∈ ⟨α 1 , d e 1 , d e 2 ⟩. Hence, α 1 , α 2 , α 3 ∈ ⟨d e 1 , d e 2 ⟩, which derives a contradiction.\nWe use S i and T i to denote the X i source region and X i sink region respectively, where i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. We can give the main result as follows.\nTheorem 4.3: Suppose c( {s 1 , s 2 }; t 2 ) = 3. Then NRG(D ∗ ) is not linearly solvable if and only if one of the following two conditions hold:\n(1) There are two different 2-dimensional region Π R 1 ,R 2 and Π S 1 ,R 3 and a P ∈ reg(S 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) such that\n, and In(T 2 ) ⊆ reg(S 1 , R 1 , P );\n(2) There are three different 2-dimensional regions Π S 1 ,R 2 , Π R 1 ,R 2 and Π R 3 ,R 4 , and a region P ∈ reg(S 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) such that R 4 ∈ Π ◦ S\nExample 4.4: Let G 1 be as in Example 2.5. The normal region graph NRG(D ∗ ) of G 1 has been shown in Fig. 5, where S 1 = R 1 ∪ R 10 , S 2 = R 2 , S 3 = R 3 , T 1 = R 9 , T 2 = R 12 and\nT 3 = R 13 . By Algorithm 2 (See Fig. 2), we can ﬁnd that Π S 2 ,S 3 = {S 2 , S 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 7 }, Π S 1 ,R 4 = {S 1 , R 4 , R 6 , R 8 , Q }, Π R 7 ,R 8 = {R 7 , R 8 , T 1 }, and Π R 7 ,Q = {R 7 , Q, R 11 } are\nall 2-dimensional regions of NRG(D ∗ ). Rename R 8 by R 1 , R 7 by R 2 , R 4 by R 3 , and R 11 by P . Then condition (1) of Theorem 4.3 holds. So NRG(D ∗ ) is not linearly solvable.\nExample 4.5: Consider a region graph NRG(D ∗ ) in Fig. 6. By algorithm 2, we can ﬁnd that Π S 2 ,S 3 = {S 2 , S 3 , R 2 , R 3 }, Π S 1 ,R 2 = {S 1 , R 2 , R 4 , R 5 }, Π R 3 ,R 4 = {R 3 , R 4 , R 1 }, Π R 3 ,R 5 = {R 3 , R 5 , P }, and Π R 1 ,R 2 = {R 1 , R 2 , T 1 } are all\n2-dimensional regions of NRG(D ∗ ). Clearly, condition (2) of Theorem 4.3 holds. So NRG(D ∗ ) is not linearly solvable.\nProof of Sufﬁciency: Suppose ¯ C = {d R ∈ F 3 ; R ∈ D} is a LNC of NRG(D ∗ ).\nSuppose condition (1) holds. If ⟨d R 1 ⟩ = ⟨α 1 ⟩, then by Deﬁnition 2.4, {α 2 , α 3 } ⊆ ⟨d S 1 , d R 1 , d P ⟩ = ⟨α 1 , d P ⟩, a contradiction. If ⟨d R 1 ⟩ ̸= ⟨α 1 ⟩, then d R 1 and α 1 are lin- early independent. By Deﬁnition 2.4, d R 1 ∈ ⟨d S 1 , d R 3 ⟩ = ⟨α 1 , d R 3 ⟩. So d R 3 ∈ ⟨α 1 , d R 1 ⟩. Similarly, since d T 1 = α 1 ∈ ⟨d R 1 , d R 2 ⟩, we have d R 2 ∈ ⟨α 1 , d R 1 ⟩. So by Deﬁnition 2.4, {α 2 , α 3 } ⊆ ⟨d S 1 , d R 1 , d P ⟩ ⊆ ⟨d S 1 , d R 2 , d R 3 ⟩ ⊆ ⟨α 1 , d R 1 ⟩, a contradiction.\nSuppose condition (2) holds. If ⟨d R 1 ⟩ = ⟨d R 4 ⟩, then by Deﬁnition 2.4, {α 2 , α 3 } ⊆ ⟨d R 1 , d R 4 , d P ⟩ = ⟨d R 1 , d P ⟩. So ⟨d R 1 , d P ⟩ = ⟨α 2 , α 3 ⟩. By Deﬁnition 2.4, d T 1 = α 1 ∈ ⟨d R 1 , d R 2 ⟩ ⊆ ⟨d R 1 , d S 2 , d S 3 , d P ⟩ = ⟨α 2 , α 3 ⟩, a contradiction. If ⟨d R 1 ⟩ ̸= ⟨d R 4 ⟩, then d R 1 and d R 4 are linearly independent. By Deﬁnition 2.4, d R 1 ∈ ⟨d R 4 , d R 3 ⟩. So d R 3 ∈ ⟨d R 4 , d R 1 ⟩. By Deﬁnition 2.4, d S 1 = d T 1 = α 1 ∈ ⟨d R 1 , d R 2 ⟩ and d R 4 ∈ ⟨d S 1 , d R 2 ⟩. So d R 4 ∈ ⟨d R 1 , d R 2 ⟩. Thus, d R 3 ∈ ⟨d R 1 , d R 2 ⟩. Also, by Deﬁnition 2.4, {α 2 , α 3 } ⊆ ⟨d R 4 , d R 1 , d P ⟩ ⊆ ⟨d S 1 , d R 2 , d R 3 ⟩ ⊆ ⟨d R 1 , d R 2 ⟩. So {α 1 , α 2 , α 3 } ⊆ ⟨d R 1 , d R 2 ⟩, a contradiction.\nWe investigated the network coding problem of two-unicast network with rate (1,2). We gave a characterization of its linearly solvability under the condition that c( {s 1 , s 2 }, t) = 3 by developing a region decomposition method.\nThis paper was supported by NSFC (No. 10990011 and No. 61170264) and the research fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China, and was supported in part by U.S. National Science Foundation grant CNS-0917087, AFOSR grant FA9550-11-C-0006, and DoD MURI Project FA9550- 09-1-0643."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R.
