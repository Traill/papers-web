For any m-ary digit d ∈ ZZ m let the Lee absolute value be deﬁned as λ(d) def = min{d, m − d} ∈ ZZ m/2 +1 (in the case m = +∞ we simply let λ(d) def = |d| ∈ IIN where |d| indicates the absolute value of d ∈ IR). For example, if m = 5 then λ(0) = 0, λ(1) = 1, λ(2) = 2, λ(3) = 2, λ(4) = 1. The Lee distance between X = x 1 x 2 . . . x n ∈ ZZ n m and Y = y 1 y 2 . . . y n ∈ ZZ n m , n ∈ IIN, is deﬁned by the real sum,\nFor example, if m = 5, n = 6, X = 012314 and Y = 443101 then d Lee (X, Y ) = λ(0 − 4 mod 5) + λ(1 − 4 mod 5) + λ(2 − 3 mod 5) + λ(3 − 1 mod 5) + λ(1 − 0 mod 5) + λ(4 − 1 mod 5) = λ(1) + λ(2) + λ(4) + λ(2) + λ(1) + λ(3) = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9. In this paper, codes for the Lee metric [2, Ch. 9], [3, Ch. 10] are designed by using methods similar to the ones used for designing codes for the L 1 metric in [4]. The L 1 -distance between m-ary words X, Y ∈ ZZ n m , is deﬁned as\nwhere X and Y are regarded as n component vectors over the real ﬁeld IR. For example, if m = 5, n = 6, X = 012314 and Y = 443101 then d L 1 (X, Y ) = |0 − 4| + |1 − 4| + |2 − 3| + |3 − 1| + |1 − 0| + |4 − 1| = 4 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 14. Some\nrelationship between the Lee distance and the L 1 distance is given in Theorem 3 of Section II. In [9], [7], [5], [6] and [4] regarding m-ary words as submultisets of a multiset, new algebraic decoding procedures for a very wide class of new and previously known EC codes are given. Such decoding procedures are based on ﬁnding the solution of a general key equation involving the elementary symmetric functions (instead of the power sums) of the received word and the unknown coefﬁcients of some error evaluator polynomials. In [5], it is shown how to decode some of these codes and other new ones to combat the errors due to the transmission through possibly asymmetric channels. In these decoding schemes, the number of errors are counted in the L 1 metric by taking into account the directionality of the errors (that is, if the errors are negative of positive). In [4] the elementary symmetric func- tion/multiset framework is used to design new classes of codes capable of correcting/detecting symmetric errors counted in the L 1 distance (2). Here, it is shown how the same framework based on computing the elementary symmetric functions of the received word is helpful in designing new codes capable of correcting/detecting symmetric or asymmetric errors counted in the Lee distance (1). This is done by reducing the design problem for Lee distance EC codes to the design of some of the L 1 distance EC codes given in [4] and [5] (see Theorem 5). In fact, some of the codes given in [4] are also good codes for the Lee distance from the theoretical (see Theorem 6) and practical perspective (see Theorem 7). For example, an m-ary code, with m = 33 of length n = 60 is given (see Example 3) with minimum Lee distance 11 (it can correct t = 5 symmetric errors measured in the Lee metric) and redundancy r = 5 log 33 121 = 6.857 check m-ary digits. Such code is essentially linear (in the sense of [5] and [4]) and so, it is easy to encode. The code can be decoded efﬁciently with t steps of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA).\nLet us ﬁx some useful notation [4]. If X = x 1 . . . x n ∈ ZZ n m is any word of length n over the m-ary alphabet ZZ m then let supp(X) def = supp I (X) indicate a subset of the index set I def = [1, n] def = {1, 2 . . . , n} where every element i ∈ [1, n] is counted with its multiplicity, m X (i) = x i ∈ ZZ m ⊆ IIN, given by the i-th component of X. Namely, X ≡ supp(X) is a multiset on [1, n], and we simply let the weight of X to be w(X) = |X| = |supp(X)| = i∈[1,n] x i = i∈[1,n] m X (i). For example, if m = 3, n = 4 and X = 2012 ∈ ZZ 4 3 then x 1 = m X (1) = 2, x 2 = m X (2) = 0, x 3 = m X (3) = 1, x 4 = m X (4) = 2, supp(X) = {1, 1, 3, 4, 4} and the weight of X is w(X) = |supp(X)| = i∈[1,n] m X (i) = 5. Let ∂X def = ∂ I X def = {i ∈ I = [1, n] : x i = m X (i) = 0} ∈ ZZ n 2 be\nthe set of indices where X is different from 0 and note that ∂X can be regarded as a subset of [1, n]. We refer to ∂X as the index set of X. The multiset supp(X) should not be confused with the index set (which is a proper set), ∂X, of X. Note that the usual Hamming weight of X is w H (X) = |∂X|, and supp(X) = ∂X if, and only if, X ∈ ZZ n 2 . For example if X = 2012, ∂X = 1011 ≡ {1, 3, 4} ⊆ [1, 4] and w H (X) = |∂X| = 3 = |supp(X)| = w(X) = 5. Let the integer scalar product between c ∈ IIN and X = x 1 x 2 . . . x n ∈ ZZ n m ⊆ IIN n be deﬁned as c · X = cx 1 cx 2 . . . cx n ∈ ZZ n c(m−1)+1 ⊆ IIN n . For example, if X = 2012 ∈ ZZ 4 3 ⊆ IIN 4 then 3 · X = 6036 ∈ ZZ 4 7 ⊆ IIN 4 .\nDeﬁne the total order in ZZ m as 0 ≤ 1 ≤ 2 ≤ . . . ≤ (m − 1) and, for all x, y ∈ ZZ m , let the minimum (maximum) operation min(x, y) (max(x, y)) be deﬁned as the minimum (maximum) between x and y, let the natural subtraction operation in ZZ m be deﬁned as x . − y def = 0 if x ≤ y, and x . − y def = x − y if x > y, where \u201c−\u201d indicates the usual integer subtraction. Then given any two words/multisets X, Y ∈ ZZ n m , the words/multiset operations X ∩ Y ∈ ZZ n m , X ∪ Y ∈ ZZ n m , X + Y ∈ IIN, and X . − Y ∈ ZZ n m are deﬁned as the digit by digit min, max, integer addition and . − operation between X and Y , respectively. For example, if m = 3, n = 8, X = 012012012 and Y = 000111222 then X ∩ Y = 000011012, X ∪ Y = 012112222, X + Y = 012123234, X . − Y = 012001000 and\nY . − X = 000100210. Given any two word X, Y ∈ ZZ n m , we say that X is contained in Y and write X ⊆ Y if, and only if, X = X ∩ Y . For example, 000011012 ≡ {5, 6, 8, 9, 9} ⊆ {2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9} ≡ 012012012. Note that the relation ⊆ deﬁnes a partial ordering in the family of multisets on [1, n] with multiplicity at most m − 1 (≡ the sets of m-ary words of length n). Under this multiset interpretation, an m-ary generalization of the binary Hamming distance between two words/submultisets X and Y can be deﬁned as the \u201csymmetric distance\u201d d S (X, Y ) = d L 1 ,Sym (X, Y ) def = |X . − Y | + |Y . − X|, which is nothing but the L 1 distance deﬁned in (2). For example, if X = 012012012 = {2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9} and Y = 000111221 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9} then X . − Y = 012001001 = {2, 3, 3, 6, 9} and Y . − X = 000100210 = {4, 7, 7, 8}, and so, d L 1 (X, Y ) = 9. In the above deﬁnitions there is nothing special in choosing I = [1, n] as index set. In fact, any other set will do.\nLet K be any ﬁeld. For all polynomials p(z) def = p 0 + p 1 z + p 2 z 2 + p 3 z 3 + . . . ∈ K[z], let p ev (z) def = p 0 + p 2 z 2 + . . . ∈ K[z] indicate the even part of p(z) and p od (z) def = p 1 z +p 3 z 3 +. . . ∈ K[z] the odd part. We say that a polynomial is even (odd) iff, p(z) = p ev (z) (p(z) = p od (z), respectively). If a polynomial is neither even nor odd then we call it mixed; otherwise, we call it unmixed. We let deg(p) ∈ IIN ∪ {−∞} indicate the degree of any polynomial p(z) ∈ K[z]. Given the ﬁeld K, let K + ⊆ K be the biggest subset of K such that a ∈ K + =⇒ −a ∈ K + . We refer to K + as the subset of positive elements in K. Let K − def = K − ({0} ∪ K + ) be the subset of negative elements in K and note that K remains partitioned as follows: K = K − ∪ {0} ∪ K + . Let S + ∈ ZZ n m be a multiset over K such that ∂S + = {a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n } ⊆ K + . In this way, ∂S − def = {−a 1 , −a 2 , . . . , −a n } ⊆ K − ; where the multiset S − ∈ ZZ n m over K is deﬁned by m S − (−a i ) def = m S + (a i ), for\nall natural i ∈ [1, n]. Furthermore, let ∂S def = ∂S − ∪ ∂S + ⊆ K and S def = S − ∪ S + ∈ ZZ 2n m . As in [5]\u2013[9], for all X ⊆ S + , let σ X (z) ∈ K[z] be the polynomial associated with X,\nwith σ ev X (z) def = 1 + σ 2 (X)z 2 + . . . and σ od X (z) def = σ 1 (X)z + σ 3 (X)z 3 + . . .. The following theorem holds [5].\nTheorem 1: Let K be any ﬁeld, S ∈ ZZ n m be a multiset with index set ∂S = {a 0 , a 1 , . . . , a n−1 } ⊆ K and σ X (z) def = z x 0 n−1 i=1 (1 − a i z) x i , for all X ⊆ S. Then, for all X, Y ⊆ S, σ X+Y (z) = σ X (z)σ Y (z) and\nIn [5], the general key equation (4) is used to design asym- metric EC codes for the L 1 metric. Here, from (4) we derive a key equation which is suitable to solve the error control code design problem for the Lee distance. First, we want to express the Lee distance (1) in terms of our language of multisets. To this purpose, we need some further notations and deﬁnitions. Let m ∈ IIN be given and recall that λ(d) def = min{d, m − d} ∈ ZZ m/2 +1 . Given X ∈ IIN n m , n ∈ IIN, let λ(X) ∈ ZZ n m/2 +1 be deﬁned by applying the λ function to every component of X; that is, m λ(X) (i) def = λ(m X (i)), for all integer i ∈ I = [1, n]. For example, if m = 5 then λ(42031) = 12021. In this way, the Lee weight of X, w Lee (X) ∈ [0, n m/2 ], can be simply deﬁned as the cardinality (or, symmetric L 1 weight) of the multiset λ(X); that is, w Lee (X) def = |λ(X)|. For example, w Lee (42031) = |12021| = 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 6. Also, given X ∈ IIN n m , let X ≤ ∈ [0, m/2 ] n ⊆ ZZ n m and X > ∈ [ m/2 + 1, m − 1] n ⊆ ZZ n m be deﬁned by\nX (i) ∈ [ m/2 + 1, m − 1] and\nrespectively. For example, if m = 5 then 42031 ≤ = 02001 ∈ [0, 2] 5 and 42031 > = 40030 ∈ [3, 4] 5 . As a direct consequence of the above deﬁnitions, note that\nX = X ≤ ∪ X > ∈ ZZ n m , X = X ≤ + X > ∈ ZZ n m ,\nλ(X > ) = m∂(X > ) . − X > ∈ ZZ n m/2 +1 , X ≤ ∩ λ(X > ) = ∅,\nλ(X) = X ≤ ∪ λ(X > ) ∈ ZZ n m/2 +1 , λ(X) = X ≤ + λ(X > ) ∈ ZZ n m/2 +1 , |λ(X)| = |X ≤ | + |λ(X > )|.\nTheorem 2: Let m, n ∈ IIN ∪ {+∞} be given. For all X, Y ∈ ZZ n m let\nE Lee + = E Lee + (X, Y ) def = (Y . − X) ≤ + λ((X . − Y ) > ) = (Y . − X) ≤ ∪ λ((X . − Y ) > ) ∈ ZZ n m/2 +1 .\nThe following relation holds for any X, Y ∈ ZZ n m . d Lee (X, Y ) = w Lee (X − Y mod m)\n= w Lee (X . − Y ) + w Lee (Y . − X) = |λ(X . − Y )| + |λ(Y . − X)|\nProof: From deﬁnition (1) of d Lee and the above deﬁ- nition of w Lee , it is readily seen that d Lee (X, Y ) = |λ(X − Y mod m)| = w Lee (X − Y mod m). Hence, the ﬁrst equality of (7) holds. With regard to the second equality of (7), let x i = m X (i) ∈ ZZ m , y i = m Y (i) ∈ ZZ m , for all i ∈ [1, n], and let \u201c− m \u201d indicate the subtraction mod m. We have\nλ(x i . − y i ) = w Lee (X . − Y ); whereas, from the deﬁnition of w Lee , \u201c . −\u201d and λ,\nλ(y i − x i ) = i∈[1,n] λ(y i . − x i ) = w Lee (Y . − X).\nThe third equality of (7) comes from the deﬁnition of w Lee . The fourth equality of (7) comes from the last relation of (5). Since the cardinality is an additive (with respect to the natural addition +) measure in ZZ n m , the ﬁfth equality of (7) holds as well. Furthermore, E Lee − = (X . − Y ) ≤ ∪ λ((Y . − X) > ) because (X . − Y ) ∩ (Y . − X) = ∅, (X . − Y ) ≤ ⊆ X . − Y (from the third relation of (5)), λ((Y . − X) > ) ⊆ (Y . − X) > ⊆ Y . − X (from the ﬁrst and third relation of (5)), and so (X . − Y ) ≤ ∩ λ((Y . − X) > ) = ∅. The above expression for E Lee − also implies that E Lee − ∈ ZZ m/2 +1 because (X . − Y ) ≤ ∈ ZZ m/2 +1 (from the ﬁfth relation of (5)), λ((Y . − X) > ) ∈ ZZ m/2 +1 (from the sixth relation of (5)) and A∪B ∈ ZZ m/2 +1 for all A, B ∈ ZZ m/2 +1 . Similarly, the analogous statement can be shown for E Lee + .\nGiven Theorem 2, the following theorem makes clear the topological relationships among the L 1 , Lee and Hamming metric; for both symmetric and asymmetric case.\nTheorem 3: Let m, n ∈ IIN ∪ {+∞}. For all X, Y ∈ ZZ n m the following relations hold for the symmetric case:\nd Lee,Sym (X, Y ) def = |λ(X . − Y )| + |λ(Y . − X)| ≤ d L 1 ,Sym (X, Y ) def = |X . − Y | + |Y . − X|;\nd H,Asy (X, Y ) def = max{|∂(X . − Y )|, |∂(Y . − X)|} ≤ d Lee,Asy (X, Y ) def = max{|λ(X . − Y )|, |λ(Y . − X)|} ≤ d L 1 ,Asy (X, Y ) def = max{|X . − Y |, |Y . − X|}.\nHence, say, a symmetric (or asymmetric) Hamming distance t-EC code is also a symmetric (or asymmetric) Lee distance t- EC code which in its turn is also a symmetric (or asymmetric, respectively) L 1 distance t-EC code.\nProof: First note that all the six functions deﬁned above are indeed distances. In particular, for all of them, the triangle inequality holds because the cardinality is a monotone additive measure in ZZ n m and for all X, Y, Z ∈ ZZ n m ,\nwhen ϕ is equal to the identity function, ϕ = λ and ϕ = ∂. Also note that d H,Sym is indeed the Hamming distance, d Lee,Sym is the Lee distance (because of Theorem 2) and d L 1 ,Sym is the L 1 distance (furthermore, note that the asymmetric equivalent of these distances can be considered and might be of interest. Indeed, the L 1 asymmetric distance d L 1 ,Asy (X, Y ) plays a fundamental role in designing the (t + , t − )-EC/(d + , d − )-ED codes in [5]). Now, since ∂(d) = |∂(d)| ≤ λ(d) = |λ(d)| ≤ d = |d|, for all d ∈ ZZ m , it follows that |∂X| ≤ |λ(X)| ≤ |X|, for all X ∈ ZZ n m . Hence, the statement of the theorem follows.\nIn spite of Theorem 3 (stating that Lee distance EC codes are also L 1 distance EC codes), as mentioned above, we reduce the design problem for Lee distance EC codes to the designs of the L 1 distance EC codes given in [4]. In this way, not only we obtain a new encoding procedure for the Berlekamp\u2019s symmetric Lee distance EC codes given in [2, Ch. 9], but get a new generalization of such symmetric codes for many values of m, d ∈ IIN where m is a multiple of a prime and d ≤ m. Furthermore, we can design Lee distance EC codes for the asymmetric case. Indeed, the expression of d Lee in Theorem 2 together with the key equation (4) gives a similar key equation for the Lee metric case. This equation is derived as follows. First note that if X is sent and Y is received then E L 1 + def = Y . − X and E L 1 − def = X . − Y are the multisets of the positive and negative errors deﬁned in the L 1 metric. On the other hand, the multisets of the positive and negative errors deﬁned in the Lee metric are E Lee + = E L 1 + ≤ ∪ λ E L 1 − > ∈ ZZ m/2 +1 and\nRelation (8) can be shown as follows. First, the multisets E L 1 + ≤ , λ E L 1 − > , E L 1 − ≤ and λ E L 1 + > are pairwise disjoint (and in particular, E Lee + ∩E Lee − = ∅) because of E L 1 + ∩E L 1 − = ∅ and the seventh relation of (5). Hence, only the following ﬁve cases are possible.\n. In this case, y i − m E Lee\n(i) = y i − (y i . − x i ) = y i − (y i − x i ) = x i mod m.\nand i ∈ λ E L 1 − > . In this case, from the sixth relation of (5), y i − m E Lee\n(i) = y i − [m . − (x i . − y i )] = y i − [m − (x i − y i )] = x i − m = x i mod m.\nand i ∈ λ E L 1 + > . In this case, y i − m E Lee\n(i) = y i + (x i . − y i ) = y i + (x i − y i ) = x i mod m.\nand i ∈ λ E L 1 + > . In this case, from the sixth relation of (5), y i − m E Lee\n(i) = y i + [m . − (y i . − x i )] = y i + [m − (y i − x i )] = x i + m = x i mod m.\n= 0 and so, form λ(0) = 0, we have y i = x i . On the other hand, y i − m E Lee\nSo, if the receiver is able to compute the error patterns E Lee + , E Lee − ∈ ZZ m/2 +1 from the received word Y then it can recover the sent word X using (8). For example, if m = 5 and X, Y ∈ ZZ 25 5 are given below, then\nX = 00000 11111 22222 33333 44444, Y = 01234 01234 01234 01234 01234,\nE L 1 + = Y . − X = 01234 00123 00012 00001 00000, E L 1 + ≤ = 01200 00120 00012 00001 00000, E L 1 + > = 00034 00003 00000 00000 00000,\nλ E L 1 + > = 00021 00002 00000 00000 00000, E L 1 − = X . − Y = 00000 10000 21000 32100 43210,\nE L 1 − ≤ = 00000 10000 21000 02100 00210, E L 1 − > = 00000 00000 00000 30000 43000,\nE Lee + = 01200 00120 00012 20001 12000, E Lee − = 00021 10002 21000 02100 00210.\nTheorem 4: Let K be any ﬁeld, S ∈ ZZ n+1 m , m, n ∈ IIN, be a multiset with index set ∂S = {a 0 = 0, a 1 , . . . , a n } ⊆ K and σ X (z) def = z x 0 n i=1 (1 − a i z) x i , for all X ⊆ S. Furthermore, let\nbe the multisets of the negative and positive errors deﬁned for the Lee metric in (6). Then, for all X, Y ⊆ S,\nProof: Let E + = Y . − X and E − = X . − Y . From Theorem 1 and the relations (5), it follows\nσ X (z)σ E + (z) = σ Y (z)σ E − (z) ⇐⇒ σ X (z)σ E ≤\n(z) ⇐⇒ σ X (z)σ E ≤\n(z) = σ Y (z)σ E ≤\n(z) ⇐⇒ σ X (z)σ E ≤\n(z) = σ Y (z)σ E ≤\n(z), and so (9) holds. In particular, the following main theorem holds.\nTheorem 5 (key equation for the Lee metric): Let K be a ﬁeld with char(K) = p, p prime. Let u, h, n, m def = up h ∈ IIN, S ∈ ZZ n m be a multiset with index set ∂S = {a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n } ⊆ K − {0} and σ X (z) def = n i=1 (1 − a i z) m X (i) , for all X ⊆ S. Furthermore, let E Lee − = E Lee − (X, Y ) ∈ ZZ n+1 m/2 +1 and E Lee + = E Lee + (X, Y ) ∈ ZZ n+1 m/2 +1 be the multisets of the negative and positive errors deﬁned for the Lee metric by (6). Then for any given d ≤ m/u = p h the following equation holds for any X, Y ⊆ S:\nAt this point we have done. In fact, under the hypothesis of Theorem 5, the code constructions deﬁned in [4] for g(z) = z d can be used to control symmetric errors in the Lee distance. Analogously, the constructions deﬁned in Theorem 5 of [5] for p(z) = z d may be used to control asymmetric errors in the Lee distance as done for the L 1 distance. In particular, for symmetric error control in the Lee metric, the following theorem deﬁnes the general code design.\nTheorem 6: Let K be any ﬁeld with char(K) = p, p odd prime. Given u, h, n, m def = up h ∈ IIN, let S + ∈ ZZ n m be a multiset with index sets ∂S + = {a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n } ⊆ K + and σ X (z) def = n i=1 (1 − a i z) m X (i) , for all X ⊆ S + .

In particular, the code word X can be recovered using (8) once the error vector E Lee has been computed from τ E Lee (z).\nProof: First note that the key equation (10) holds true in the hypothesis of this theorem because of Theorem 5. Hence, the proof follows exactly as the proof of Theorem 3 in [4] where the key equation (4) is replaced with the equation (10). In this way, note that the relations of (8) in [4] can be derived modz d , which is what is needed in the remaining part of the proof. Furthermore, the lower bound on the code cardinality follows from the analysis given in Example 1 in [4].\nParticularly interesting for efﬁcient code design is the case σ(z) = 0. In fact, the following theorem holds.\nTheorem 7: Let S i (X) def = x 1 a i 1 + x 2 a i 2 + . . . + x n a i n be the i-th power sum of X ∈ ZZ n m . In the same hypothesis of Theorem 6, assume d = 2t + 1 ≤ p ( ⇐⇒ t ≤ (p − 1)/2 ), and σ(z) = 0. Then C 0,z d (S + ) =\nX ⊆ S + : σ od X (z) = σ od X mod p (z) = 0 mod z 2t+1 = {X ⊆ S + : σ 1 (X) = σ 3 (X) = . . . = σ 2t−1 (X) = 0} = {X ⊆ S + : S 1 (X) = S 3 (X) = . . . = S 2t−1 (X) = 0} .\nHence, C 0,z d ((p − 1)∂S + ) is a p-ary linear code. Furthermore, if s def = up h−1 ∈ IIN and m = sp ∈ IIN then 1) the following representation holds for the m-ary code C 0,z d ((m − 1)∂S + ):\nC 0,z d (m − 1)∂S + = ZZ n s · p + C 0,z d (p − 1)∂S + \t (13) (in the above equation the sum and product are those de- ﬁned in the naturals); 2) the minimum Lee distance of C 0,z d ((m − 1)∂S + ) is d Lee (C 0,z d ((m − 1)∂S + )) ≥ d = 2t + 1; and 3) the redundancy is\nProof: Given Theorem 6, the proof follows exactly as the proof of Theorem 4 in [4].\nExample 1: Let K = GF (17), p = 17, u = 1, h = 1 m = up h = 17, ∂S + = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} ⊆ K + , n = |S + | = 8 ≤ (|K| − 1)/2 = 8, S + = (m − 1)∂S + = 16∂S + ≡\nt = 3 ≤ (p h − 1)/2 = 8). Theorem 6 implies that there exists a code C σ = C σ,z d (S + ) with the following parameters.\ncode alphabet m = 17, length n = 8,\nThis code can be efﬁciently decoded to, say, correct 3 errors by solving the key equation (12). Furthermore, Theorem 7 implies that the code C 0 has the same parameters as above, redundancy ρ(C 0 ) = 3 and is a linear code (so, it can be efﬁciently encoded too). Actually, C 0 is a Berlekamp\u2019s like code [3, page 314\u2013316] which can be efﬁciently decoded in a new way by using (12).\nExample 2: Let K = GF (3 3 ), p = 3, u = 2, h = 2 m = up h = 18, ∂S + ⊆ K + , n = |S + | = 13 ≤ (|K| − 1)/2 = 13, S + = (m − 1)∂S + = 17∂S + , d = 9 ≤ p h = 9 ( ⇐⇒\nt = 4 ≤ (p h − 1)/2 = 4). Theorem 6 implies that there exists a code C σ = C σ,z d (S + ) with the following parameters.\ncode alphabet m = 18, length n = 13,\nExample 3: Let K = GF (11 2 ), p = 11, u = 3, h = 1 m = up h = 33, ∂S + ⊆ K + , n = |S + | = 60 ≤ (|K|−1)/2 = 60, S + = (m − 1)∂S + = 32∂S + , d = 11 ≤ p h = 11 ( ⇐⇒\nt = 5 ≤ (p h − 1)/2 = 5). Theorem 6 implies that there exists a code C σ = C σ,z d (S + ) with the following parameters.\ncode alphabet m = 33, length n = 60,\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant CCF-1117215 and by the Italian MIUR Grant PRIN 2009-2009EL7424."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"Y.
