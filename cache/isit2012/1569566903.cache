In this work, the Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel is con- sidered, with multiple users and any number of antennas at each node. A \u201cclosed loop\u201d scenario is assumed, for which a practical capacity-achieving multicast scheme is constructed. In the proposed scheme, linear modulation is carried over time and space together, which allows to transform the problem into that of transmission over parallel scalar sub-channels, the gains of which are equal, except for a fraction of sub-channels that vanishes with the number of time slots used. Over these sub-channels, off-the- shelf ﬁxed-rate AWGN codes can be used to approach capacity."},"body":{"text":"A recurring theme in digital communications is the use of a standard \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d coding module in combination with appropriate linear pre/post processing which is tailored to the speciﬁc channel model. Such methods are appealing due to their low complexity of implementation as well as conceptually, since the task of coding and modulation are effectively decoupled.\nUnderlying such decoupling schemes is the existence of a diagonalization transformation. For time-invariant scalar sys- tems, this is possible via the Fourier transform. The singular- value decomposition (SVD) plays a similar role for Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. In recent years, as coding and decoding for single-user scalar channels has reached a mature stage, research effort has shifted to tackling the more ambitious goal of efﬁcient multi-user (and multi-antenna) communication networks.\nExtension of the decoupling approach which is at the heart of single-user scalar systems to a multiple-user MIMO net- work requires, however, overcoming a major hurdle: (unitary) simultaneous diagonalization is in general not possible. 1\nHence, different practical approaches were proposed over the years for the problem of multicasting over Gaussian MIMO broadcast channels. However, none of these approaches is ca- pacity achieving in general, even for simple cases. To illustrate this, consider the following simple three-user example:\nwhere α and β are chosen such that the (individual) capacities of all channels are equal, viz.\nC p2p 2 log(1 + |α| 2 P/2) = log(1 + |β| 2 P ) . (2) This example models a \u201cnear\u2013far\u201d scenario in which the\ntwo \u201cnear\u201d users have one antenna each, where each receives a different transmit antenna stream, whereas the \u201cfar\u201d user is equipped with two antennas to compensate for the distance attenuation, such that the capacities of all channels are equal.\nA na¨ıve approach would be to use Vertical Bell-Laboratories Space\u2013Time coding (V-BLAST) [1] or generalized decision feedback equalization (GDFE) [2]. This approach is based upon the QR decomposition, in which the output of the channel is multiplied by a unitary matrix, resulting in an effective triangular channel matrix. In the case of the example, however, repetition coding across the antennas must be used, to convey the (common) message to users 2 and 3. This, in turn, implies that the far user (user 1) cannot enjoy any of its multiplexing gain (which is equal to two in this case), due to the repetition that is carried across the two transmit antennas. Again, in the high SNR regime, this suggests a loss of approximately half of the optimal achievable rate. Moreover, for this example the \u201cmax\u2013min beamforming\u201d technique (see, e.g., [3] and references therein) reduces to this scheme as well, meaning that it suffers the same losses in performance.\nAnother approach considered in the literature for this prob- lem is that of using a \u201cpure open-loop\u201d approach, namely Alamouti [4] \u2014 for the two-transmit antenna case, and space\u2013 time coding [5] \u2014 for more. The performance of these schemes does not depend on the number of receivers. However, this universality comes at the price of a substantial rate loss for MIMO channels having several receive antennas, as these schemes use only a single stream, thus failing to achieve the multiplexing gain offered by the MIMO channel. 2\nFinally note that time/frequency sharing suggest a great loss in performance (up to two thirds of the capacity in this case).\nIn general, to the best of our knowledge known practical schemes are limited to the smallest number of degrees of freedom (\u201cmultiplexing gain\u201c) of the different users, or alter- natively incorporate time- or frequency-sharing, which again lose degrees of freedom. Thus, these schemes achieve only a fraction of the available degrees of freedom.\nIn this work we develop a scheme that achieves the degrees of freedom of each individual channel, by enabling the trans- mission of several streams as is done in V-BLAST/GDFE in\nthe point-to-point case. This is done by designing a special space\u2013time coding structure that is tailored for the speciﬁc channel matrices, where the number of channel uses that is needed to be jointly processed depends on the number of users in the system. However, in contrast to the open-loop space\u2013time coding structures, which strive for an \u201corthogonal design\u201d structure (see, e.g., [5]), the space\u2013time structure presented in this work results in triangular forms, similar to V-BLAST/GDFE, but having equal diagonals, which suggests in turn, the optimality of the scheme. This gives rise to ef- fective parallel scalar additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, over which standard codes can be used to approach capacity. Thus, the proposed scheme could be thought of as an interpolation between the open-loop space\u2013time coding technique and the point-to-point V-BLAST one.\nThe K-user Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel consists of one transmit and K receive nodes, where each received signal is related to the transmitted signal through a MIMO link:\nThe aim of the transmitter is to multicast the same (com- mon) message to all the receivers. The capacity of this scenario is long known to equal the (worst-case) capacity of the compound channel (see, e.g., [6]), with the compound parameter being the channel matrix index:\nC {H i } K i=1 , P = max C x\nwhere I(H i , Cx) is the mutual information between the channel input x and the channel output y i , obtained by taking x to be Gaussian with covariance matrix Cx:\nIn this section we recall the transmission and receiving scheme for the single- and two-user cases, and explain how this scheme can be generalized to the multi-user case.\nThe proposed scheme in this section is based on several forms of matrix decompositions, one of which is the geometric mean decomposition (GMD) [7]. For simplicity, we will only consider the decomposition of square matrices throughout this work. As we show in the sequel, this does not pose\nany restriction on the communication problem addressed. The GMD [7] of a square complex invertible matrix A is given by:\nwhere U, V are unitary matrices, and T is an upper-triangular matrix such that all its diagonal values equal to the geometric mean of the singular values of A, which is real and positive.\nBuilding on the GMD, the following decomposition, which will be referred to as Joint Equi-diagonal Triangularization (JET), was introduced in [8]. Let A 1 and A 2 be two in- vertible complex matrices of dimensions n × n such that | det(A 1 )| = | det(A 2 )| . Then, the joint triangularization of A 1 and A 2 is given by:\nwhere U 1 , U 2 , V are n × n unitary matrices, and R 1 , R 2 are upper-triangular n × n matrices with the same real-valued, non-negative diagonal values, namely,\nB. Point-to-Point MIMO Scheme via Matrix Triangularization We now review the transmission scheme known as the\nuniform channel decomposition (UCD) [9], which is in turn based upon the derivation of the MMSE version of Vertical Bell-Laboratories Space\u2013Time coding (V-BLAST), see, e.g., [10]. Later in the paper we take the triangularization to be one which is simultaneously good for several users.\nNext, the matrix ˜ G is transformed into a square matrix, by means of the QR decomposition:\nwhere Q is an (n r +n t )×n t matrix with orthonormal columns and G is an n t × n t upper-triangular matrix with real-valued positive diagonal elements. Now the matrix G is decomposed according to the GMD:\nwhere T is upper-triangular whose diagonal values are equal to nt det (G) , which are, in turn, equal to the effective signal- to-noise ratios of the scalar sub-channels.\n1) Construct n t codewords of equal rates for a scalar AWGN channel of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) nt det (G) .\n2) In each channel use, an n t -length vector ˜x is formed using one sample from each codebook. The transmitted vector x is then obtained using the following precoder:\nx = C 1/2 x V ˜ x . 3) The receiver calculates\n4) Finally, the codebooks are decoded using successive in- terference cancellation, starting from the n t -th codeword and ending with the ﬁrst one: The n t -th codeword is de- coded ﬁrst, using the n t -th element of ˜y, treating the other codewords as AWGN. The effect of the n t -th element of ˜ x is then subtracted out from the remaining elements of ˜ y . Next, the (n t − 1) -th codeword is decoded, using the (n t − 1) -th element of ˜y \u2014 and so forth.\nThe optimality of this scheme, i.e., that it is capacity achieving, was proved in [8, Sec. IV].\nThe scheme of Section III-B can be generalized to the K- user case in a straightforward manner. 5 However, in order to approach the capacity (3), using the same scalar codebook over all scalar sub-channel, as in Section III-B, the existence of a joint unitary matrix decomposition of the form\nis required, assuming A i are square invertible matrices with equal determinants (up to phase), of dimensions n × n, where U i are unitary matrices (corresponding to operations per- formed at the receivers), V is unitary as well (corresponding to an operation performed by the transmitter) and T i are upper- triangular matrices with constant diagonals. Unfortunately, such a decomposition does not exist in general for more than one matrix since there are not enough degrees of freedom offered by the unitary matrices, as the unitary matrix on the right, V , is the same for all decomposed matrices {A i } (corre- sponding to the common operation carried at the transmitter); for more details see [11]. To overcome this problem, in order to gain more degrees of freedom, we propose to utilize multiple channel uses of the same channel realization and process them together. The idea of mixing the same symbols between multiple channel uses has much in common with space\u2013time codes [4], [5]. In the next section we show how, using this idea, nearly optimal joint triangularization may be obtained.\nWe now show how to utilize a space\u2013time structure in order to obtain nearly-optimal joint triangularization of K matrices, such that the resulting triangular matrices have constant diag- onals, up to a small portion of the diagonal extreme elements. The resulting scheme becomes asymptotically optimal for large values of N, where N is the number of channel uses grouped together for the purpose of joint decomposition. This result is stated in the following theorem.\nTheorem 1 (Nearly-Optimal K-GMD): Let A 1 , . . . , A K be complex-valued n × n matrices satisfying | det(A i )| = 1 , and deﬁne the following nN × nN extended matrices:\nThen there exist matrices U 1 , . . . , U K , V , of dimensions nN × n N − (n K−1 − 1) , with orthonormal columns, such that:\nwhere N ≥ n K−1 and ∗ represents some value (which may differ within each matrix as well as between different ones).\nBy using this decomposition, the same scheme as in Sec- tion III can be employed, such that the N channel uses are effectively transformed into n N − (n K−1 − 1) equal-rate scalar AWGN channels. The sum of the capacities of these channels tends to the capacity of the original channel for large values of N, where the only loss comes from edge effects (truncation of the extreme n K − n elements).\nRemark 1: For the case where the matrices have non-equal determinants, the K-GMD Theorem 1 results in K triangular matrices, each with a constant diagonal with entries that are equal to n | det (A i )| .\nRemark 2: It was shown in [11, Lemma 1] that K-GMD is equivalent to (K +1)-JET. Hence, nearly-optimal (K +1)-JET can be obtained with the same parameters as in Theorem 1.\nWe provide a proof in the form of a constructive algorithm for a special case, which demonstrates the essence for the general case. The algorithm for the general case is available in [12], [13] (as implementations in Matlab and Python, respectively) and is not provided here due to space constraints.\nDeﬁnition 1: Let A and B be matrices of dimensions n×m and 2×2, respectively. We deﬁne the operation of \u201cextraction\u201d of indices i and j from A by:\nI B n ( i m i , n i ) as the replacement of the elements in the identity matrix I n in the index-pairs contained in m 1 , n 1 m 2 , n 2 m 3 , n 3 , . . . , 6 with the elements contained in B, where index overlap is forbidden, i.e., all the indices {m i } ∪ {n i } are unique. For example, the embedding I B 4 ( 1, 3 2, 4 ) of\nAlgorithm for n = 2, K = 3, N = 4: Denote by {A i } the augmented matrices corresponding to N = 4 channel uses.\nStage 1: Start by applying a 1-GMD for each block (corre- sponding to a single channel use) of the ﬁrst matrix A 1 :\nwhich corresponds, in turn, to applying the following extended unitary matrices\nNote that the same matrix V (1) has to be applied to all matrices (since the encoder is shared by all users). We decompose the resulting matrices (after multiplying them by V (1) ) according to the QR decomposition, resulting in unitary matrices U (1) i \u2020 such that:\nStage 2: In the second stage we apply the 1-GMD decom- position to the matrices T (1) 2 2, 5 and T (1) 2 4, 7 . In both cases the two-by-two matrices are of the same form:\nNow note that the matrix corresponding to these elements in T (1) 1 have the identity matrix form I 2 . Thus, V (2) on the right and V (2) \u2020 on the left result in the identity matrix:\nThus, we attain the following matrices after the completion of the second stage:\nAgain, note that the corresponding sub-matrices of T (3) 1 and T (3) 2 are equal to I 2 . Hence, multiplying them by V (3) on the right and V (3) \u2020 on the left, gives rise to the identity matrix I 2 . By deﬁning\nBy taking the middle rows and columns (rows and columns 4 and 5) we achieve the desired decomposition with diagonal elements equaling to 1 in all three triangular matrices simulta- neously. 7 Formally we do so by deﬁning the next matrix which is composed of rows 4 and 5 of the identity matrix I 8 ,\nAccording to Theorem 1, even when the number of users K is not very large, a large number of channel uses need to by combined and processed together in order to approach the capacity. We demonstrate this phenomenon by considering the example of the introduction (1) where the gains α and β and the power constraint P satisfy (2), i.e., that the individual capacities are equal.\nFor this case, the best achievable rate of the existing prac- tical schemes, described in the introduction, is single-stream beamforming, which is therefore taken to be the benchmark which we aim to improve. Nonetheless, this scheme does not utilize the two degrees of freedom offered by the ﬁrst channel H 1 . This becomes more signiﬁcant in the high SNR regime, in which this benchmark rate achieves only half of the available (multicast) capacity (3). For the proposed scheme in this paper, we provide in Table I the number of channel uses needed to be combined and processed together to achieve given portions of the capacity, where for comparison, we present in the table the benchmark rate and the rate achieved by time-sharing between\nthe users, for the case of P → ∞ and the case in which the individual capacities (2) equal to C p2p = 10 bits channel use . 8\nFor more users (larger K), the ratio between the benchmark rate and the capacity deteriorates rapidly as K grows large. However, the number of channel uses needed to achieve a certain percentage of the capacity, using the approach devel- oped in this paper, grows rapidly. Yet, based on numerical evidence, we believe that the number of required channel aug- mentations can be reduced. Furthermore, for special families of MIMO channels, very signiﬁcant reduction is possible, as demonstrated in [14]."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"P. W. Wolniansky"},{"name":"G. J.
