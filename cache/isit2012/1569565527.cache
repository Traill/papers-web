Under these assumptions, we study the available degrees of freedom as well as the optimal way to assign messages to transmitters. For the case where each message is assigned to the transmitter with the same index, we know from [1] that KN N +1 DoF is achievable for the considered locally connected channel using interference alignment as the number of symbol extensions goes to inﬁnity. In this work, we show that a simple linear strategy employing zero forcing transmit beams achieves min \t 2M N M (N +1)+L , 1 per user degrees of freedom. In particular, the N N +1 per user DoF is achievable by coding over only one channel realization, for any value of M ≥ L N +1 .

In this work, we assess the performance of two ways to enhance the infrastructure of wireless networks, and study their role in managing interference. The ﬁrst enhancement is to deploy multiple antennas at each transmitter, and the second is to use a backhaul link to allow each message to be available at multiple transmitters, i.e., Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) transmission [3]. To this end, we study a K−user MISO interference channel where each message can be available at a maximum of M transmitters, each of which has N antennas. Also, to capture the effect of distance based path losses in wireless channels, we assume that each transmitter is connected to only the receiver carrying its own index as well as L neighboring receivers that are located in a symmetric fashion around it.\nFollowing recent results in [4] and [5], the per user degrees of freedom number was characterized in [2] for a special case of the considered channel model obtained by setting N = L = 1. In particular, the optimal coding scheme was\nshown to satisfy a local cooperation constraint and employ a simple zero forcing transmit beamforming strategy. Here, we extend the result on the optimality of local cooperation for a general setting of the parameters N , M , and L. Moreover, we generalize the scheme in [2] for values of N, L > 1, and show that the proposed scheme is optimal among the class of all coding schemes relying on zero forcing transmit beamforming. We further use those results to compare the following two cases: (i) the case where each transmitter has multiple antennas but no cooperation is allowed (M = 1, N > 1), and (ii) the case where each transmitter has a single antenna and cooperation is allowed (N = 1, M > 1). Finally, we derive a general upper bound on the per user DoF number that reduces to the one in presented in [2] for the special case of N = L = 1.\nWe use the standard model for the K−user interference channel with N -antenna transmitters and single antenna re- ceivers.\nwhere t is the time index, X (n) i (t) is the transmitted signal of the n th antenna at transmitter i, Y i (t) is the received signal of receiver i, Z i (t) is the zero mean unit variance Gaussian noise at receiver i, and H (n) ij (t) is the channel coefﬁcient from the n th antenna at transmitter j to receiver i over the t th time slot. We remove the time index in the rest of the paper for brevity.\nWe use [K] to denote the set {1, 2, . . . , K}. For any set A ⊆ [K], we deﬁne the complement set ¯ A = {i : i ∈ [K], i / ∈ A}. For each i ∈ [K], let W i be the message intended for receiver i, we use the abbreviations W A , X A , Y A , and Z A to denote the sets {W i , i ∈ A}, {X (n) i , n ∈ [N ], i ∈ A}, {Y i , i ∈ A}, and {Z i , i ∈ A}, respectively.\nIn order to capture the local connectivity of the channel, we assume a channel model that is a function of the number of interferers L. In particular, ∀n ∈ [N ],\nH (n) ij is not identically 0 if and only if i− L 2 ≤ j ≤ i+ L 2 (2)\nand all channel coefﬁcients that are not identically zero are drawn independently from a continuous distribution. We note that for values of L = 1 and L = 2, the channel reduces the commonly known Wyner\u2019s asymmetric and symmetric linear models, respectively.\nFor each i ∈ [K], let W i be the message intended for receiver i, and T i ⊆ [K] be the transmit set of receiver i, i.e., those transmitters with the knowledge of W i . The transmitters in T i cooperatively transmit the message W i to the receiver i. The messages {W i } are assumed to be independent of each other. The cooperation order M is deﬁned as the maximum size of a transmit set:\nThe total power constraint across all the users is P . Let W i denote the alphabet for message W i , then the rates R i (P ) =\nare achievable if the decoding error probabilities of all messages can be simultaneously made arbitrarily small for large enough n. The capacity region C(P ) is the set of all achievable rate tuples. The total number of degrees of freedom (η) is deﬁned as lim sup P →∞ C Σ (P ) log P , where C Σ (P ) is the sum capacity. Since η depends on the speciﬁc choice of transmit sets, as well as the speciﬁc realization of the channel coefﬁcients, we deﬁne η(K, N, M, L) as the best achievable η over all choices of transmit sets satisfying the cooperation order constraint in (3), and holds for almost all realizations of a K−user locally connected channel deﬁned as above with N −antenna transmitters, and the channel coefﬁcients satisfy (2). In order to simplify our analysis, we deﬁne the per user DoF number τ (N, M, L) to measure how η(K, N, M, L) scales with K while all other parameters remain ﬁxed.\nFor the above described channel model where L > 1, let x = L 2 . We silence the ﬁrst x transmitters, and deactivate the last x receivers, relabel the transmit signals to obtain a (K−x)- user channel where the i th transmitter is connected to receivers in the set {Y k : k ∈ {i, i + 1, . . . , i + L}}. We note that the new channel model gives the same value of τ (N, M, L) as the original one, as x = o(K). Unless explicitly stated otherwise, we will be using this equivalent model in the rest of the paper.\nIn this section, we consider a simple linear precoding coding scheme, where each message is assigned to a set of transmitters with successive indices, and a zero-forcing transmit beamforming strategy is employed. The availability\nof each message at multiple antennas allows a design for the corresponding transmit vectors to null the interference caused by the message at selected receivers. More precisely, the transmit signal at the n th antenna of the j th transmitter is given by,\nwhere X (n) j,i depends only on message W i . In [2], a coding scheme in the above form was employed to provide an asymptotic characterization of the per user degrees of freedom for Wyner\u2019s linear asymmetric model with single antenna transmitters. i.e., the case where N = 1 and L = 1, and it was shown that τ (N = 1, M, L = 1) = 2M 2M +1 . In the following, we generalize the coding scheme in [2] to provide a lower bound on the per user DoF for arbitrary values of the system parameters.\nProof: We ﬁrst consider the case where M N < L+M by treating the network as clusters, each consisting of consecutive M (N + 1) + L transceivers. The last L transmitters in each cluster are deactivated to eliminate inter-cluster interference, and hence, it sufﬁces to show that 2M N DoF can be achieved in each cluster. Without loss of generality, consider the cluster with users of indices in the set [M (N + 1) + L]. Deﬁne the following subsets of [M (N + 1) + L],\nIn the proposed scheme, messages with indices in the set [M (N + 1) + L]\\(S 1 ∪ S 2 ) are not transmitted and the cor- responding receivers are deactivated. The remaining messages are assigned as follows,\nT i = {1, 2, . . . , M }, \t ∀i ∈ S 1 {M N + 1, M N + 2, . . . , M (N + 1)}, \t ∀i ∈ S 2\nand all other transmitters in the cluster are deactivated. In other words, the ﬁrst M N messages in the cluster are assigned to transmitters in the set [M ], and the last M N messages in the cluster are assigned to the M transmitters with indices in the set {M N + 1, M N + 2, . . . , M (N + 1)}.\nNow, we note that messages with indices in S 1 are not available outside transmitters with indices in [M ], and hence, do not cause interference at receivers with indices in S 2 . Also, messages with indices in S 2 are not available at transmitters with indices in [M N ], and hence, do not cause interference at receivers with indices in S 1 .\nIn order to complete the proof by showing that each user in S 1 ∪ S 2 achieves one degree of freedom, we next show that transmissions corresponding to messages with indices in S 1 (S 2 ) do not cause interference at receivers with indices in the same set. Let S 1,j denote the set {(j −1)N +1, (j −1)N + 2, . . . , jN } where j ∈ [M ], and consider the design of trans- mit beams for messages W i , i ∈ S 1,j . Our aim is to create an\ninterference-free communication between the (i − (j − 1)N ) th antenna at the j th transmitter to the i th receiver. We prove this by showing the existence of an assignment for the transmit signals {X (n) k,i : n ∈ [N ], k ∈ [M ], (k, n) = (j, i − (j − 1)N )} to cancel the interference caused by W i at the M N − 1 receivers in S 1 \\{i}. Consider the design of the transmit beam at the n th antenna of the k th transmitter X (n) k,i , where n ∈ [N ], k ∈ [M ], (k, n) = (j, i−(j −1)N ), and note that given all other transmit signals carrying W i , X (n) k,i can be designed such that the interference caused by W i at the ((k − 1)N + n) th receiver is canceled. Therefore, the interference cancellation constraints pose a system of M N − 1 equations in M N − 1 variables, where each equation is assigned a distinct variable, that can be set to satisfy it, given any assignment of the other M N − 2 variables. Moreover, the considered equations are linearly independent almost surely, as we assume that channel coefﬁcients are drawn independently from a continuous dis- tribution. It is easy to see that there exists an assignment of the variables to satisfy the equations for almost all channel realizations.\nWe ﬁnally note that the channel between transmitters with indices in the sequence (M (N +1), M (N +1)−1, . . . , M N + 1) and receivers with indices in the sequence (L + M (N + 1), L+M (N +1)−1, . . . , L+M +1) has the same connectivity pattern to the channel between transmitters with indices in the sequence (1, 2, . . . , M ) and receivers with indices in the sequence (1, 2, . . . , M N ), and hence the argument in the previous paragraph can be used to construct transmit beams for messages W i , i ∈ S 2 such that each user in S 2 gets access to an interference-free transmission (one degree of freedom).\nThe proof is simpler for the case where N M ≥ L + M . Let x min = min x {x ∈ N : N x ≥ L + x}, then x min ≤ M , and the messages are assigned as T i = {i, i + 1, . . . , i + x min − 1}. Consider the design of transmit beams for message W i . Our aim is to allow for interference-free communication between the ﬁrst antenna at the i th transmitter and the i th receiver, and eliminate the interference caused by W i at all receivers in the set {i + 1, . . . , i + L x min − 1}. We omit the rest of the proof for brevity as the design of transmit beams is similar to the above described proof of the ﬁrst case.\nWe note that in the above coding scheme, some messages are not being transmitted in order to allow for interference- free communication for the remaining messages. It is worth noting that this can be done while maintaining fairness in the allocation of the available DoF over all users in a system where multiple sessions of communication take place by deactivating different sets of receivers in different sessions. e.g., in different time slots or different sub-carriers in an OFDM system.\nIn Section V, we show that the lower bound stated in (6) is tight in special cases. Here, in order to assess the optimality of the above result for arbitrary values of the system parameters, we consider a class of coding schemes that only employs a Zero Forcing Transmit Beam-Forming strategy. i.e., the transmit signals are of the form (5) and each message is either not transmitted or it is allocated one degree of freedom.\nMore precisely, let ˜ Y j = Y j − Z j , ∀j ∈ [K], then in addition to the constraint in (5), the differential entropy h( ˜ Y j |W j ) is either 0 or equals h( ˜ Y j ) for all j ∈ [K]. Note that h( ˜ Y j |W j ) = 0 for the case where user j enjoys interference- free communication and h( ˜ Y j |W j ) = h( ˜ Y j ) for the other case where W j is not transmitted. Let τ ZF (N, M, L) denote the asymptotic characterization of the per user DoF number under the restriction to the above described class of coding schemes. In Theorem 2 below, we show that the coding scheme in the proof of Theorem 1 achieves the optimal value of τ ZF (N, M, L). We ﬁrst prove the following lemma that bounds the number of receivers at which the interference of a given message can be canceled. For a set S ⊆ [K], let V S be the set of indices for active receivers connected to transmitters with indices in S. More precisely, V S = {j : h( ˜ Y j |W j ) = 0, S ∩ {j, j − 1, . . . , j − L} = φ}, where φ is the empty set. To obtain the following results, we assume that for each transmitter in T i , message W i contributes to the transmit signal of at least one antenna at this transmitter. i.e., ∀j ∈ T i , ∃n ∈ [N ] : I(W i , X (n) j,i ) > 0. Note that this assumption does not introduce a loss in generality as otherwise the transmitter can be removed from T i . We need the following lemma for the proof of the upper bound on τ ZF (N, M, L) in Theorem 2.\nProof: The proof is available in the journal version of this work [6], and we omit it here for brevity. The key idea is that since the probability of a zero measure set of channel realizations is zero, the N |T i | transmit signals carrying W i cannot be designed jointly to cancel W i at more than N |T i |−1 receivers for almost all channel realizations.\nProof: The proof of the lower bound is the same as the proof of Theorem 1. It then sufﬁces to show that τ ZF (N, M, L) ≤ \t 2M N M (N +1)+L for the case where N M < L + M . In order to prove the upper bound, we show that the sum degree of freedom in each set S ⊆ [K] of consecutive M (N + 1) + L users is bounded by 2M N . Assume otherwise, then there is an active user in S that lies in the middle of a subset of 2M N + 1 active users in S. More precisely, ∃i ∈ S : |T i | > 0, |{j : j < i, j ∈ S, h( ˜ Y j |W j ) = 0}| ≥ M N, |{j : j > i, j ∈ S, h( ˜ Y j |W j ) = 0}| ≥ M N . Let s min = min s {s : s ∈ S} and s max = max s {s : s ∈ S}, then if ∃s ∈ T i : s ∈ {s min , s min − 1, . . . , s min − L}, it follows that V T i ⊇ {j : j < i, j ∈ S, h( ˜ Y j |W j ) = 0} ∪ {i}, hence |V T i | ≥ M N + 1, which contradicts (7). Also, if ∃s ∈ T i : s ∈ {s max , s max − 1, . . . , s max − L}, then V T i ⊇ {j : j > i, j ∈ S, h( ˜ Y j |W j ) = 0} ∪ {i}, hence |V T i | ≥ M N + 1, which again contradicts (7). Finally, for the remaining case, by applying Lemma 2, we know that T i does not contain a transmitter with an index that is less than\ns min or greater than s max , hence, at least L + |T i | receivers in S are connected to one or more transmitters in T i , and since S has at least 2M N + 1 active receivers, then any subset of L + |T i | receivers in S has to have at least 2M N + 1 − ((L + M (N + 1)) − (L + |T i |)) = M N + |T i | − (M − 1) active receivers, hence,\n|V T i | ≥ M N + |T i | − (M − 1) \t (9) = N |T i | + (M − |T i |)(N − 1) + 1 \t (10) ≥ N |T i | + 1 \t (11)\nand the statement is proved by reaching a contradiction to (7) in the last case.\nIn order to characterize an upper bound on the per user DoF τ (N, M, L), we have to consider all possible message assignments satisfying the cooperation order constraint (3). In this section, we use results from [2] to characterize necessary conditions for the optimal message assignment.\nFor message W i , and a ﬁxed transmit set T i , we construct the following graph G W i ,T i that has [K] as its set of vertices, and an edge exists between any given pair of vertices x, y ∈ [K] if and only if,\n\u2022 Corresponding transmitters are both connected to at least one receiver. In the channel model deﬁned in (2), this condition reduces to |x − y| ≤ L.\nVertices corresponding to transmitters connected to Y i are given a special mark, i.e., vertices with labels in the set {i, i − 1, . . . , i − L} are marked for the considered channel model.\nLemma 2 ([2], Lemma 1): For any k ∈ T i such that the vertex k in G W i ,T i belongs to a component that does not contain a marked vertex, removing k from T i does not decrease the sum rate.\nWe call a message assignment useful if no element in it can be removed without decreasing the sum rate. The following corollary to the above lemma characterizes a necessary con- dition for any message assignment satisfying the cooperation order constraint in (3) to be useful.\nCorollary 1: Let T i be a useful message assignment and |T i | ≤ M , then ∀k ∈ [K], k ∈ T i only if the vertex k in G W i ,T i lies at a distance that is less than or equal M − 1 from a marked vertex.\nNote that in the considered channel model, the above result implies that T i ⊆ {i − M L, i − M L + 1, . . . , i + (M − 1)L}. In the coding scheme illustrated in Section III, we use a message assignment that satisﬁes the condition in Corollary 1. Furthermore, each transmit set consists of a successive set of transmitter indices. More precisely,\nand hence, assigning each message to a successive set of trans- mitters is a property of the optimal assignment of messages\nwith the restriction to zero-forcing transmit beamforming cod- ing schemes. While we observe that Lemma 2 does not imply that transmit sets have to consist of successive transmitter indices, it is intuitive to think that such a condition is necessary as it minimizes the number of receivers at which each message causes undesired interference.\nIn order to prove an upper bound on the per user DoF, we perform two initial steps. First, we simplify the combinatorial aspect of the problem by restricting our search for message assignments satisfying the cooperation order constraint to only a special class of such assignments. Second, we prove a condition of equivalence, in terms of the considered criterion, between the considered channel model and another model that is obtained by removing some of the receivers, thereby bounding the DoF of the channel by the number of receivers in the equivalent model.\nThe ﬁrst step is dealt with in Section IV. While we noted that Lemma 2 does not necessarily imply the condition stated in (12), we will be restricted in this section to message assignments satisfying (12), as it will allow us to derive an upper bound for arbitrary system parameters. For the second step, we use a general lemma for upper bounding the available degrees of freedom for reliable communication over a multiuser channel.\nFor any set A ⊆ [K], Deﬁne U A = ∪ i / ∈A T i . Assume that η degrees of freedom are available for the considered channel.\nLemma 3 ([2], Lemma 2): If there exists a set A ⊆ [K] and a function f , such that f Y A , Z A , X ¯ U A = X U A , then η ≤ |A|.\nLet ˜ τ (N, M, L) be the maximum achievable per user DoF for the considered channel model τ (N, M, L), where only message assignments satisfying (12) are considered.\nTheorem 3: If N M ≥ L + M , then ˜ τ (N, M, L) = 1, otherwise,\nProof: The lower bounds follow from Theorem 1. We only need to show the upper bound for the case where N M < L+M . By carefully inspecting the lower and upper bounds, we note that they coincide for the case where N M = L + M − 1. This guides our choice in that special case for the set A when applying Lemma 3 to the set of active receivers in the proof of Theorem 1. i.e., we view the network as clusters, each consisting of successive M (N + 1) + L = 2M N + 1 users, and we remove the middle receiver from each cluster. We then generalize this choice for general values of N, M, and L such that N M < L + M by viewing the network as clusters, each consisting of M (N + 1) + L successive users, and we remove the (L + M ) th receiver from each cluster. It then sufﬁces to show that the condition in Lemma 3 holds for this choice of the set A. More precisely, Let the set A be deﬁned as follows.\nWe then need to show that there exists a function f , such that f Y A , Z A , X ¯ U A = X U A .\nTo prove the existence of the function f described above, we ﬁrst note that by using the condition in (12), we know that for any message with an index that lies at the intersection of the set ¯ A and a given cluster, all members of its transmit set have indices that belong to the same cluster, and consequently, for any positive integer j, T (M (N +1)+L)(j−1)+L+M = U A ∩ {(M (N +1)+L)(j −1)+1, . . . , (M (N +1)+L)j}. Now, we\nknow that the number of unknown transmit signals in X U A in the ﬁrst cluster is less than or equal to M N , and by removing the effect of the signals X ¯ U A and Z A from Y A , we obtain at least M N linear equations in X U A ∩[M (N +1)+L] . We ﬁnally show in [6] that those linear equations contain a subset of M N independent linear equations and thereby the missing signals can be recovered. The proof for the remaining clusters follows in a similar fashion.\nAs we note that Lemma 2 implies the condition in (12) for the special where M = 1 and where L = 1, i.e., τ (N, M, L) = ˜ τ (N, M, L) if min(M, L) = 1. We have the following corollaries to Theorem 3.\nCorollary 2: For the case where each message can be made available at only one transmitter (M = 1), then τ (N, M = 1, L) = 1 if N ≥ L + 1, and otherwise,\nCorollary 3: ([2], Theorem 1) For Wyner\u2019s Asymmetric Channel model (L = 1), τ (N, M, L = 1) = 1 if N ≥ 2, and otherwise,\nConsider a comparison between two different scenarios. In the ﬁrst, each message can be transmitted from a single transmitter that has x antennas, i.e., N = x, M = 1, while in the second scenario, each message can be transmitted from x single antenna transmitters, i.e., N = 1, M = x. We note that the number of receivers at which a given mes- sage causes undesired interference is L in the ﬁrst scenario, and is at least L + x − 1 in the second. For this reason, τ ZF (N = x, M = 1, L) > τ ZF (N = 1, M = x, L), ∀x > 1.\nIt is worth noting that the number of receivers at which each message causes undesired interference is not the only difference between the considered scenarios. In particular, other differences between the two scenarios affect the available DoF when considering general coding schemes beyond the simple zero forcing transmit beamforming scheme considered in Section III. In the fully connected model where all channel coefﬁcients are drawn independently from a continuous dis- tribution, the number of receivers at which a given message causes undesired interference is the same for both considered scenarios. However, the per user DoF number for the ﬁrst scenario where x antennas are dedicated to each message is\n, while for the case where each transmitter has a single antenna, and M = x = 2, the per user DoF number is shown to be 1 2 in [7].\nAlthough we do not provide a tight characterization for τ (N, M, L), we know from Corollary 1 that the optimal message assignment satisﬁes a local cooperation constraint, that is, each transmit set is restricted within a radius that does not scale linearly with K. More precisely, for all values of K,\nT i ⊆ {i − r(K), i − r(K) + 1, . . . , i + r(K)}, ∀i ∈ [K] (17) where r(K) = o(K).\nIn this work, we considered a class of MISO interference channels with symmetric local connectivity under a cooper- ation constraint that bounds the number of transmitters at which any message can be available by a cooperation order M . We then characterized the per user DoF number for zero forcing transmit beamforming strategies that do not require the use of symbol extensions. In particular, it was shown that using a ﬁxed cooperation orders that does not scale with the number of users, the proposed scheme achieves more than the 1 2 per user DoF number that is obtained without cooperation (see [8]). Moreover, the per user DoF number approaches unity as the cooperation order increases. We then proved an upper bound on the per user DoF number that is tight for special settings of the system parameters. The per user DoF number characterized in [2] for Wyner\u2019s asymmetric model follows as a special case of the shown lower and upper bounds. Finally, the tradeoff between adding an extra antenna at each transmitter and incrementing the cooperation order, is discussed in light of the derived results."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"T.
