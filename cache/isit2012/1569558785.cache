In fact, they were initially proposed by Golomb and Gong [2] as a component of S-boxes to ensure the security of symmetric cryptosystems. But such functions are rare and, not only their characterization, but also their generation are challenging problems.\nIn 2008, Charpin and Gong [3] studied the hyper-bentness of Boolean functions with multiple trace terms in the following form:\nwhere n = 2m is an even integer, R is a set of representatives of the cyclotomic classes modulo 2 m + 1 of full size n and a r ∈ F 2 m . This class was extended by Mesnager [4], [5], and later by Wang et al. [6]\u2013[8], to include additional trace terms on F 4 and on F 16 with respective exponents 2 n −1 3 and\n. Both these approaches are quite similar and crucially depend on the fact that the hypothesis made on the extension degree implies that 3 and 5 do not only divide 2 n − 1, but also 2 m + 1. In this paper, we show how such approaches can be extended to an inﬁnity of different trace terms, covering all the possible Dillon-like exponents. In particular, we show that they are valid for an inﬁnite number of other denominators, e.g. 9 or 11. To this end, we consider a function of the general\nwhere n = 2m is an even integer, R is a set of representatives of the cyclotomic classes modulo 2 m + 1, a r ∈ F 2 m , s divides 2 m + 1, that is s(2 m − 1) is a Dillon-like exponent, t is the size of the cyclotomic coset of s modulo 2 m + 1, and b ∈ F 2 t .\nIn Section II, we provide some background on the different objects we use. Section III and IV build the core of this paper: in the former one, we study general Dillon-like exponents; in the latter one, we devise for which extension degrees a given exponent is valid. Section V then provides both known and new applications of the developed theory.\nThroughout this paper, m ≥ 0 is a positive integer and n = 2m is an even integer. The base ﬁeld for our work will be F 2 m , but our ﬁnal motivation is the study of Boolean functions deﬁned over F 2 n . The element α denotes a primitive element of F 2 n . While working over ﬁnite ﬁelds, we use the shorthand notation 1/0 = 0. For any set S such that 0 ∈ S, S ∗ denotes S ∗ = S \\ {0} and |S| denotes the cardinality of S.\nEvery non-zero Boolean function f deﬁned on F 2 n has a trace expansion of the form\nwhere Γ n is a set of representatives of the cyclotomic classes modulo 2 n − 1, the coefﬁcients a j are in F 2 n , and = wt(f ) modulo 2. Such a representation can be made unique by restricting the coefﬁcients a j to F 2 o(j) and by writing f as\nwhere o(j) is the size of the cyclotomic coset of j modulo 2 n − 1. It is then called the polynomial form of f .\nThe \u201csign\u201d function of a Boolean function f is the integer- valued function χ f = χ (f ) = (−1) f , i.e. f composed with the additive character of F 2 .\nThe extended Walsh\u2013Hadamard transform of f is deﬁned as\nfor ω ∈ F 2 n and k an integer co-prime with 2 n − 1. A hyper- bent functions can be deﬁned as follows.\nDeﬁnition II.1. A Boolean function f on F 2 n is said to be hyper-bent if its extended Walsh\u2013Hadamard transform only takes the values ±2 n 2 .\nRecall that the family of binary Dickson polynomials D r (x) ∈ F 2 [x] is deﬁned by\nThe reader can refer to the monograph of Lind, Mullen and Turnwald [9] for many useful properties and applications of Dickson polynomials. In particular, for any non-zero positive integers r and s, Dickson polynomials satisfy\nLet f be a Boolean function on F 2 m . We denote the exponential sum associated with f by Ξ(f ), that is\nThe following partial exponential sums are a classical tool to study hyper-bentness.\nDeﬁnition II.2. Let f be a Boolean function on F 2 n and U be the set of (2 m + 1)-th roots of unity in F 2 n . We deﬁne Λ(f ) as\nDeﬁnition II.3. Let f be a Boolean function on F 2 m . For i ∈ F 2 , let T i denote the set T i = {x ∈ F 2 m | Tr m 1 (1/x) = i}, and T i (f ) the partial exponential sum\nThe family of Boolean functions F n consists of the func- tions f a given by Dillon-like only exponents, that is\nwhere R is a set of representatives of the cyclotomic classes modulo 2 m + 1 and a r ∈ F 2 n . Departing from the approach of Charpin and Gong, we do not require that the cyclotomic cosets are of maximal size n = 2m.\nLemma III.1. Let f a be a Boolean function in F n . Then f a (α 2 m +1 x) = f a (x).\nIn the following theorem, we express the complete extended Walsh\u2013Hadamard spectrum of f a with Λ(a) = Λ(f a ).\nTheorem III.2. Let f a be a Boolean function in F n . For ω = 0,\nRemark III.3. Set f a (x) = \t r∈R Tr n 1 (a r x r ), and let Λ(a) = Λ(f a ). The (2 m − 1)-power map induces a permuta- tion of U , so that Λ(a) = Λ(a).\nWe now restrict to the family G n of Boolean functions deﬁned as above, but with a r ∈ F 2 m . The following remark shows that it is enough to restrict to Dillon-like exponents whose cyclotomic coset sizes do not divide m.\nRemark III.4. If t = o(r(2 m − 1)), then Tr n 1 a r x r(2 m −1) = Tr t 1 Tr n t (a r ) x r(2 m −1) . Suppose now that a r ∈ F 2 m , e.g. f a ∈ G n . If t divides m, then Tr n t (a r ) = Tr m t a r + a 2 m r = 0 and Tr n 1 a r x r(2 m −1) = 0. Otherwise, if k = gcd(t, m), then Tr n t (a r ) ∈ F 2 k .\nFurthermore, Theorem III.2 can be used to compute the dual of f a in the case where f a is hyper-bent.\nProposition III.5. Suppose that f a ∈ G n is hyper-bent. Then it is its own dual, i.e. we have χ f a (ω) = 2 m χ f a (ω).\nRemark III.3 combined with the transitivity of the trace yields a useful expression of Λ(a).\nLemma III.6 ( [5, Lemma 12]). Let f a ∈ G n and g a be deﬁned on F 2 m as g a (x) = r∈R Tr m 1 (a r D r (x)). Then Λ(f a (x l )) = 1 + 2T 1 (g a ◦ D l ) for any l ≥ 0.\nIt is then straightforward to prove the following extension of the Charpin\u2013Gong criterion [3, Theorem 7].\nTheorem III.7. Let f a ∈ G n and g a be deﬁned on F 2 m as g a (x) = r∈R Tr m 1 (a r D r (x)). Then f a is hyper-bent if and only if T 1 (g a ) = 0.\nThe above approach yields criteria for hyper-bentness in- volving only one exponential sums over U ⊂ F 2 n or T 1 ⊂ F 2 m . In the latter case, the restriction that lies on the coefﬁcients a r is not satisfactory. In this subsection, we extend the approach of Mesnager to partially address this issue and consider the family H n of Boolean functions deﬁned as\nwith R and a r ∈ F 2 m as before, s divides 2 m +1, t = o(s(2 m − 1)), and b ∈ F 2 t . Moreover, let τ = 2 m +1 s . Remark that f a,0 = f a where f a ∈ G n is the function deﬁned in the previous subsection and set\nRemark III.8. According to Remark III.4, the family H n is always strictly larger than the family G n .\nLet U = u ∈ F ∗ 2 n | u 2 m +1 = 1 be the subgroup of F ∗ 2 n of order 2 m + 1, V = {v ∈ F ∗ 2 n | v s = 1} its subgroup of order s and W = {w ∈ F ∗ 2 n | w τ = 1} its subgroup of order τ . Denote by α a primitive element of F 2 n . Then ζ = α 2 m −1 is a generator of U and ξ = ζ s is a generator of W ⊂ F ∗ 2 t . The set U can be decomposed as U = τ −1 i=0 ζ i V .\nDeﬁnition III.9. For 0 ≤ i ≤ τ − 1, deﬁne S i (a) to be the partial exponential sums\nRemark III.10. The Boolean function f a,b is hyper-bent if and only if Λ(a, b) = 1. Moreover, Remark III.3 can be extended to f a,b and f a,b and yields Λ(a, b) = Λ(a, b). Finally, Proposition III.5 can be extended to show that, if f a,b is hyper- bent, then its dual is f a,b 2m .\nRemark III.11. One has τ −1 i=0 S i (a) = Λ(a, 0) = Λ(a). In particular, Lemma III.6 yields τ −1 i=0 S i (a) = 1 + 2T 1 (g a ).\nProposition III.13. Let l be a divisor of τ and let k be the integer k = τ /l. Then\nProof: Since l divides 2 m + 1, the l-power map is l-to-1 from U onto k−1 i=0 ζ il V . Therefore,\nTo conclude this section, further identities can be obtained by restricting a r to a strict subﬁeld of F 2 m .\nProposition III.14. Let l be a divisor of m and k = m/l. Suppose that a r ∈ F 2 l and that 2 l ≡ j (mod τ ). Then\nBut the (2 l )-power map and multiplication by ζ i(2 l −j) induce permutations of V and therefore\nRemark III.15. In the particular case where l = m, note that 2 m ≡ −1 (mod τ ), so that S i (a) = S −i (a).\nIt is a difﬁcult problem to deduce general characterizations of hyper-bentness in terms of complete exponential sums from the results of the current section, that is characterizations valid for any m, s and b. Nevertheless, several applications valid for new inﬁnite families are described in Section V.\nIn the previous subsection, we set an extension degree m and studied the corresponding exponents s. It is however customary to go the opposite way around, i.e. set an exponent and devise characterizations valid for an inﬁnity of extension degrees. In this section, we provide the link between these two approaches.\nLet ﬁrst τ = p be an odd prime number. There exists i such that 2 i ≡ −1 (mod p) if and only if the order of 2 modulo p is even. In this case, taking m ≡ l (mod 2l), where 2l is the order of 2 modulo p, yields an inﬁnite family of values of m for which 2 m ≡ −1 (mod p). The size t = o(s) of the cyclotomic coset of s = (2 m + 1)/p modulo 2 m + 1, is then t = 2l. Furthermore, one has 2 m ≡ 2 l (mod 2 t − 1), so that if f a,b ∈ H n is hyper-bent, then its dual is f a,b 2l .\nTo actually devise such prime numbers, we now focus on the speciﬁc case where 2 is primitive. In this situation, the above condition becomes\nFor such a prime number p, taking m ≡ p−1 2 (mod p − 1) yields an inﬁnite family of values of m for which 2 m ≡ −1 (mod p), the corresponding denominator being τ = p. The size t = o(s) of the cyclotomic coset of s = (2 m + 1)/p modulo 2 m + 1, is then t = p − 1.\nFinding an inﬁnite number of odd prime numbers for which 2 is primitive would thus give an elegant solution to our problem, i.e. ﬁnding an inﬁnite family of denominators τ associated with inﬁnite families of extension degrees m. This problem is a special case of Artin\u2019s conjecture on primitive roots. It has been proved by Hooley [10] under the Gen- eralized Riemann Hypothesis. Heath-Brown [11] has proved unconditionally that there exist at most two exceptional primes for which it fails; nonetheless, this proof is non-constructive. Anyhow, the sequence of such primes is sequence A001122 in OEIS [12] and begins with\nThe extension of the above treatment to the case where τ = p k is a prime power with k ≥ 2 is straightforward. The group of units modulo p k is indeed cyclic, so that the condition for the prime case is thus still valid. Moreover, if a is primitive modulo p 2 , then it is modulo p k for any k ≥ 2 and 2 φ(pk ) 2 ≡ −1 (mod φ(p k )) where φ denotes Euler\u2019s totient function.\nIn practice, more can be said. Indeed, if 2 is primitive modulo p, but is not modulo p 2 , then 2 p−1 ≡ 1 (mod p 2 ), that is p is a Wieferich prime. Only two of them are currently known: 1093 and 3511; and 2 is not primitive modulo both of these primes. Checking that 2 is primitive modulo p is therefore enough to ensure that it is modulo any power of p as long as p is less than ﬁfteen decimal digits [13].\nWe conclude this section with the case of a product of at least two different odd prime numbers for which the group of units is not cyclic anymore. Nonetheless, the order of 2 modulo τ is the least common multiple of its orders modulo the prime powers and there exists an integer i such that 2 i ≡ −1 (mod τ ) if and only if they are even and share the same 2-adic valuation.\nIn this section, we show how the results of Section III can be applied to several inﬁnite families of Boolean functions in or- der to obtain characterizations of their hyper-bentness in terms of complete exponential sums. Much of these applications can be straightforwardly extended to other cases.\nWe begin with the speciﬁc case where b = 1. In particular, there exists β ∈ F 2 m such that Tr n t (β) = 1 and f a,1 belongs to both families G n and H n . Applying Theorem III.7 shows that f a,1 is hyper-bent if and only if\nThe results of Subsection III-B give a different characteriza- tion. Let ξ be a primitive τ -th root of unity. First, ξ lies in F 2 t , so that τ −1 i=0 ξ i = 0. Second, remark that the results of Section IV imply that t is even, so that Tr t 1 (1) = 0. Moreover, ξ is a (2 t/2 + 1)-th root of unity so that ξ + ξ −1 ∈ F 2 t/2 which implies that Tr t 1 ξ i = Tr t 1 ξ −i . Nonetheless, the trace of ξ i for i = 0 depends on the exact value of τ .\nFor simplicity, we suppose that τ = p k is a prime power and that 2 is primitive. Then t = φ(p k ). Let i = lp e with l co-prime with p − 1 and 0 ≤ e ≤ k − 1 so that\nThe ﬁrst two sums of the right hand side of the last equality are zero. If 0 ≤ e ≤ k − 2, then the third sum is zero as well, and if e = k − 1, then it is one. Proposition III.12 ﬁnally reads\np k Λ(a, 1) = 4T 1 (g a ◦ D p k )) − 4pT 1 (g a ◦ D p k−1 ) + 2p k T 1 (g a ) + p k − 2p + 2 .\nThe previous subsection dealt with a ﬁxed value of b ∈ F ∗ 2 t casting as few restrictions as possible on τ . We now treat the ﬁrst few possible values of τ for all values of b with as few restrictions as possible on the coefﬁcients a r .\nThe ﬁrst value for τ = 3 was addressed by Mesnager [5] in 2010. The second one τ = 5 was addressed by Wang et al. [6] in late 2011. Their results can be straightforwardly deduced from the above theory. For τ = 7, the order of 2 is odd.\nIn the case τ = 9, t = 6 and m ≡ 3 (mod 6). Moreover, if the coefﬁcients a r lie in F 2 l , where l = m/3, then 2 l is −1, 2 or −4 modulo 9 when l is respectively 0, 1 and 2 modulo 3. In the last two cases, Proposition III.14 tells that\nPropositions III.12 and III.13 and explicit computations of the traces Tr 6 1 bξ i yield the following characterizations where m b (x) is the minimal polynomial of b.\n1) If m b (x) = x + 1, then 9Λ(a, 1) = 4T 1 (g a ◦ D 9 ) − 12T 1 (g a ◦ D 3 ) + 18T 1 (g a ) + 5.\n2) If m b (x) = x 2 +x+1, then 9Λ(a, b) = −2T 1 (g a ◦D 9 )− 6T 1 (g a ◦ D 3 ) + 18T 1 (g a ) + 5.\n3) Suppose moreover that a r ∈ F 2 m 3 and m 3 ≡ 0 (mod 3). a) If m b (x) = x 3 +x+1 or x 6 +x+1, then 9Λ(a, b) =\nb) If m b (x) = x 3 + x 2 + 1 or x 6 + x 4 + x 2 + x + 1, then 9Λ(a, b) = 4T 1 (g a ◦ D 9 ) − 4T 1 (g a ◦ D 3 ) − 6T 1 (g a ) − 3.\nc) If m b (x) = x 6 + x 3 + 1, then 9Λ(a, b) = 4T 1 (g a ◦ D 3 ) + 6T 1 (g a ) + 5.\nd) If m b (x) = x 6 + x 5 + x 4 + x 2 + 1, x 6 + x 5 + x 3 + x 2 + 1 or x 6 + x 5 + x 4 + x + 1, then 9Λ(a, b) = −2T 1 (g a ◦ D 9 ) + 2T 1 (g a ◦ D 3 ) − 6T 1 (g a ) − 3.\ne) If m b (x) = x 6 + x 4 + x 3 + x + 1, then 9Λ(a, b) = 4T 1 (g a ◦ D 9 ) − 8T 1 (g a ◦ D 3 ) + 6T 1 (g a ) + 1.\nf) If m b (x) = x 6 + x 5 + 1 or x 6 + x 5 + x 2 + x + 1, then 9Λ(a, b) = −2T 1 (g a ◦ D 9 ) − 2T 1 (g a ◦ D 3 ) + 6T 1 (g a ) + 1.\nTo conclude this subsection, we give the only result for τ = 11 which is valid without restriction on the coefﬁcients a r ∈ F 2 m , apart from the case b = 1 included above.\nTheorem V.3. Let τ = 11 and m ≡ 5 (mod 10). If m b (x) = x 2 + x + 1, x 10 + x 9 + x 8 + x 3 + x 2 + x + 1, x 10 + x 9 + x 8 + x 4 + x 3 + x 2 + 1, or x 10 + x 9 + x 8 + x 6 + x 5 + x + 1, then 11Λ(a, b) = −2T 1 (g a ◦ D 11 ) − 1.\nThe family we considered above actually contain hyper-bent functions. For example, f a,b is hyper-bent when:\n\u2022 τ = 9, m = 27, R = {1}, a 1 = x 26 + x 25 + x 23 + x 22 + x 20 + x 16 + x 9 + x 6 , and b = 1;\n\u2022 τ = 11, m = 15, R = {1, 3}, a 1 = x 1066 , a 3 = x 19316 , and b = 1;\nthe ﬁnite ﬁeld F 2 m being represented as F 2 [x]/(C m (x)) where C m (x) is the m-th Conway polynomial.\nIn this paper, we have extended previous characterizations of hyper-bentness by Charpin and Gong, Mesnager, and Wang et al., to much wider classes of Boolean functions, giving as well more insight on the tools and restrictions involved in these approaches. A challenging question is to prove that speciﬁc families of Boolean functions considered in this paper, that is restricted to a given set of indices R, contain an inﬁnite number of hyper-bent functions. The case of monomial func- tions with the Dillon exponent is a much celebrated theorem of Lachaud and Wolfmann [14, Theorem 3.4]. The case of binomial functions with the Dillon exponent and an additional trace term over F 4 has been treated by Mesnager [4], that of binomial functions with the Dillon exponent and an additional trace term over F 16 has been treated by Wang et al.
