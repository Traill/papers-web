Although, there exist efﬁcient sub-optimal decoders with reduced complexity for polar codes, the complexity of the optimum ML decoder increases exponentially. Hence the optimum decoder is infeasible for the practical implementation of polar coding. In this paper, our motivation is about developing efﬁcient ML decoder with reduced complexity. In this purpose, polar code based sphere decoding algorithm is proposed with the optimal performance. Additionally, proposed technique exploits two properties of polar coding to reduce decoding complexity. By this way, the reduced complexity of optimal decoding is only cubic, not exponential.\nIndex Terms\u2014ML estimation, Polar codes, Reed-Muller codes, Sphere Decoding.\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\nmin 1 2\nTable.1: Complexity vs. ML performance for the target BERs Number of visited nodes\nfor Target BER=10 −2 \t (8,5) (16,13) (32,26) (64,57) Parallelized tree of P \t 1.5E1 1.7E2 \t 5.9E3 \t 2.4E5 Search tree of P \t 2.0E1 1.9E2 \t 7.7E3 \t 2.7E5 Search tree of RM \t 2.4E1 3.1E2 \t 7.8E3 \t 5.5E5 Exhaustive search comp. 1.6E2 1.0E5 \t 1.7E9 8.2E18 Number of visited nodes\nfor Target BER=10 −3 \t (8,5) (16,13) (32,26) (64,57) Parallelized tree of P \t 1.5E1 1.6E2 \t 5.4E3 \t 1.4E5 Search tree of P \t 1.9E1 1.9E2 \t 6.2E3 \t 1.6E5 Reduced comp. of RM \t 2.4E1 3.0E2 \t 6.2E3 \t 3.4E5 Exhaustive search comp. 1.6E2 1.0E5 \t 1.7E9 8.2E18 Number of visited nodes\nfor Target BER=10 −4 \t (8,5) (16,13) (32,26) (64,57) Parallelized tree of P \t 1.5E1 1.5E2 \t 5.1E3 \t 1.3E5 Search tree of P \t 1.8E1 1.8E2 \t 5.8E3 \t 1.6E5 Search tree of RM \t 2.3E1 2.9E2 \t 5.8E3 \t 2.5E5 Exhaustive search comp. 1.6E2 1.0E5 \t 1.7E9 8.2E18"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"E.
