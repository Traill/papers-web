All nodes in the network are assumed to be oblivious to their forward- channel gains, however, they have perfect information about their backward-channel gains. We also assume a stringent decoding delay constraint of one fading block that makes the deﬁnition of ergodic (Shannon) capacity meaningless. Hence, we adopt the broadcast approach to increase the expected-rate received at the destination. The focus of this paper is on simple, efﬁ- cient, and practical relaying schemes to increase the average achievable rate at the destination. The maximum expected-rate of ON/OFF based amplify-forward relaying is analytically derived. For further performance improvement, a hybrid decode-amplify- forward relaying strategy, adopting the broadcast approach at the source and relays, is proposed and its maximum throughput and expected-rate are presented.

Fading is often used for modeling the wireless channels. The growing demand for quality of service (QoS) and network coverage inspires the use of several intermediate wireless nodes to help the communication among distant nodes, which is referred to as relaying or multi-hopping. The problems of transmission between a disconnected source and destination via two parallel relays were analyzed in [1] for the additive white Gaussian (AWGN) channels and in [2] for the case where the relays transmit in orthogonal frequency bands/time slots. Diversity gains in a parallel relay network using distributed space-time codes, where channel state information (CSI) is only at the receivers, was presented in [3].\nThe growing adoption of broadcast mobile TV services suggests that they have the potential to become a mass market application. A good example for such networks is a TV broadcasting system from a satellite to cellphones through base stations where users with higher quality channels might receive additional services, like high deﬁnition TV signal [4].\nHowever, the quality and success of such services are governed by guaranteeing a good coverage, particularly in areas that are densely populated. This paper suggests the use of relays to provide better coverage in such strategically important areas. The main transmitter which is a central TV broadcasting unit (like a satellite) uses two parallel relays in large density areas to improve coverage. According to the large number of relay pairs covering their respective areas and also the large number of users in each designated area, neither the main transmitter nor the relays can access the forward-channel state information. Due to the stringent delay constraint, the transmission block length is forced to be much shorter than the dynamics of the slow fading process, though still large enough to yield a reliable communication. Shamai and Steiner [5] proposed a broadcast approach (multi-layer coding) for a single user block fading channel with no CSI at the transmitter, which optimizes the average decodable rate. This approach was used in [6] for the dual-hop single-user channel and in [7] for cooperation between two collocated users. Multi-layer coding can also achieve the maximum average rate in a block fading multiple-access channel with no CSI at the transmitters [8]. The optimum trade-off between the QoS and network coverage in a multicast network was characterized in [4] using the broadcast approach.\nThe authors proposed a decode-forward (DF) relaying strat- egy adopting multi-layer coding for the parallel relay network in [9]. The average achievable rate performance improvement in the proposed scheme was elaborated.\nIn this paper, for further performance improvement, other relaying strategies adopting multi-layer coding over dual-hop networks with parallel relays are proposed, where neither the transmitter nor the relays access their forward-channel gain. The main focus of this work is on simple and efﬁcient schemes, since the relays can not buffer multiple packets and also handle large delays. First, amplify-forward (AF) relaying is analyzed. In contrast to DF relaying, in AF relaying, the re- lays do not need to know the codebook used by the source, and also there is no decoding delay at the relays. The performance of AF relaying will be improved using the concept of ON/OFF AF relaying. In ON/OFF AF relaying, each relay with the backward-channel gain less than a pre-determined threshold becomes silent. In terms of performance with throughput and expected-rate metrics, in the cases where the ratio of the relay power to the source power is high, the proposed AF relaying outperforms the DF relaying presented in [9]. For further\nperformance improvement, a hybrid decode-amplify-forward scheme called DAF is proposed, where each relay decodes and forwards a portion of the layers and ampliﬁes and forwards the rest. Note that no relay has any information about the number of layers being decoded by the other relay. As it turns out from the numerical results, the proposed DAF strategy outperforms both DF and AF schemes. For both schemes, the maximum throughput and expected-rate are formulated. To verify the performance of the schemes, two upper-bounds on maximum expected-rate of the network are obtained. The ﬁrst one is based on full cooperation between the relays, while the second upper-bound is the network cutset-bound. It is shown that the proposed hybrid DAF meets the upper-bounds for low values of the ratio of the relay power to the source power.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section II, the preliminaries are presented. The maximum achievable throughput and continuous-layer expected-rate of ON/OFF based AF relaying is derived in section III. The multi-layer DAF relaying scheme is proposed in section IV, and its max- imum achievable throughput and expected-rate are analyzed. Upper-bounds on the maximum throughput and expected-rate of the network in consideration are obtained in section V. In section VI, numerical results are provided. Finally, section VII concludes the paper.\nThroughout the paper, we represent the expectation op- eration by E( ·) and the probability of event A by P{A}. The notation \u201c ln\u201d is used for natural logarithm, and rates are expressed in nats. We denote by f x ( ·) and F x ( ·) the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative den- sity function (CDF) of random variable x, respectively. For every function F (x), let us deﬁne F (x) = 1 − F (x) and\n. We denote the conjugate and absolute value operators by ∗ and | · |, respectively. CN (0, 1) denotes the complex circularly symmetric Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance. U(·) is the unit step function, and E 1 (x) △ = ∞ x e −t t dt, x ≥ 0, is the exponential integral function. We always assume that E |X i | 2 = 1, ∀i.\nLet us ﬁrst restate the network model. As ﬁg. 1 shows, the destination receives data via two parallel relays and there is no direct link between the source and the destination. The source is transmitting a signal X subject to the total\naverage power constraint P s , and the received signal at the i\u2019th relay is denoted by Y r i = h r i X + Z r i , i = 1, 2. The i.i.d. AWGN at the i\u2019th relay is represented by Z r i ∼ CN (0, 1), and h r i ∼ CN (0, 1) is the channel coefﬁcient from the transmitter to the i\u2019th relay. The i\u2019th relay forwards a signal X r i to the destination under the total average power con- straint P r . Hence, the received signal at the destination is Y = h 1 X r 1 + h 2 X r 2 + Z, where Z ∼ CN (0, 1) is the i.i.d. AWGN and h i ∼ CN (0, 1) is the channel coefﬁcient from the i\u2019th relay to the receiver. All h i and h r i are assumed to be constant during two consecutive transmission blocks. Obviously, channel gains a i = |h i | 2 and a r i = |h r i | 2 have exponential distribution.\nNote that the transmitter as well as both relays and the receiver are equipped with one antenna. We assume that the relays operate in a full-duplex mode and they are not capable of buffering data over multiple coding blocks or rescheduling tasks. Since there is no link between the relays, the half-duplex mode is a direct result of the full-duplex mode with frequency or time division.\nA simple but efﬁcient relaying solution for parallel relay networks is to amplify and forward the received signals. In order for the destination to coherently decode the signals, it employs a distributed space-time code permutation along with the threshold-based ON/OFF power scheme, which has been shown that improves the performance of AF relaying [3]. According to the ON/OFF concept, any relay whose backward-channel gain is less than a pre-determined threshold, namely a th , is silent. In this scheme, the relays transmit the signals to the destination in two consecutive time slots. In time slot t, the ﬁrst (resp. second) relay transmits c 1 Y r 1 (t) (resp. c 2 Y r 2 (t + 1)). In time slot t + 1, the ﬁrst (resp. second) relay transmits −c 1 Y ∗ r 1 (t + 1) (resp. c 2 Y ∗ r 2 (t)) with the backward- channel phase compensation [3]. To satisfy the relays\u2019 power constraint, it is required that c i = U ( a ri −a th ) P r a\n, i = 1, 2. At the destination, the channels are parallelized using the Alamouti decoding procedure [10].\nThe maximum achievable throughput of the above AF scheme is speciﬁed by\nwhere a AF, 2 is the equivalent channel gain between the source and the destination when both relays are ON:\nand a AF, 1 is the equivalent channel gain when only the i\u2019th relay is ON:\nF a AF,2 and F a AF,1 are the CDFs of a AF, 2 and a AF, 1 , respec- tively. a th △ = P r 1+P s +P r is the optimum ON/OFF threshold.\nTo increase the average achievable rate at the destination, a multi-layer code is transmitted at the source. Since the expected-rate increases with the number of code layers, the continuous-layer (inﬁnite-layer) expected-rate of the above AF scheme is presented in theorem 1, which does not lend itself to a closed form expression. The proof is omitted, due to the lack of space.\nTheorem 1 The maximum average achievable rate of the above scenario is given by\nf eq (x) d x, (4)\nThe integration limits are the solutions to F eq (x 0 ) = x 0 (1 + P s x 0 )f eq (x 0 ) and F eq (x 1 ) = x 1 f eq (x 1 ), respectively.\nRemark In the above results, the power constraint P r has been applied only to the time slots when the relays are ON. Alternatively, one can assume that the relays have the ability to save their power while working in the OFF state and consume it in the ON state. In this case, all the above calculations are valid except for the integration limit x 0 which is now the solution to F eq (x 0 ) = x 0 (1 + e Pr 1+ Ps+Pr P s x 0 )f eq (x 0 ).\nIn this section, we propose a DAF relaying strategy which takes advantage of amplifying the layers that could not be decoded at the relays in the DF scheme of [9]. Speciﬁcally, each relay tries to decode as many layers as possible and forward them by spending a portion of its power budget. The remaining power is dedicated to amplifying and forwarding the rest of the layers. One important feature of this scheme is that all layers are combined coherently at the destination although each relay has no information about the number of layers being successfully decoded by the other relay.\nIn order to enhance the lucidity of this section, single-layer coding is studied ﬁrst. The idea is then extended to multi-layer coding. As the continuous-layer expected-rate of this scheme is a seemingly intractable problem, a ﬁnite-layer coding scenario is analyzed.\nA single-layer code X = γX 1 with power P s , i.e., γ 2 = P s , and rate R = ln(1 + P s s ) is transmitted. If a r i ≥ s, then the i\u2019th relay decodes the signal and forwards it, otherwise, it ampliﬁes and forwards the signal to the destination. In time\nslot t, the ﬁrst (resp. second) relay transmits X r 1 (t) (resp. X r 2 (t + 1)). In time slot t + 1, the ﬁrst (resp. second) relay transmits −X ∗ r 1 (t + 1) (resp. X ∗ r 2 (t)) with the backward- channel phase compensation . There are three possibilities:\n1) a r 1 ≥ s and a r 2 ≥ s: both relays decode the signal. In this case DAF is simpliﬁed to DF (see [9]).\n2) a r 1 < s and a r 2 < s: none of the relays decodes the signal. This case is simpliﬁed to AF (see section III).\n3) a r 1 ≥ s, a r 2 < s or a r 1 < s, a r 2 ≥ s: only one relay decodes the signal.\nIn the third case, without loss of generality, assume that the ﬁrst relay decodes the signal and the second relay does not decode it, i.e, a r 1 ≥ s, a r 2 < s. Hence, X r 1 (t) = αX(t) and X r 2 (t) = c 2 Y r 2 (t) = c 2 (h r 2 γX 1 (t) + Z r 2 (t)), where α 2 =\n. Using a coding procedure similar to distributed Alamouti code [9], the received signal to noise ratio at the destination can be expressed as α 2 a 1 +c 2 γ 2 a 2 a r2 1+a\na 1 , then DAF outperforms DF, otherwise, we switch to DF, that is the second relay becomes silent. Since the relays do not know the value of a 1 , they use its expected value. As a result, the ampliﬁcation coefﬁcient of DAF can be written\n. It can be shown that the maximum throughput of this scheme is given by\nApplying the ﬁnite-layer broadcast approach, the source transmits a K layer code X = K l =1 γ l X l to the relays, where γ l represents the power allocated to the l\u2019th layer with rate R l = ln 1 + \t γ 2 l s l 1+ K\n. Each relay decodes its received signal from the ﬁrst layer up to the layer that its backward-channel conditions allow and forwards them to the destination. Afterwards, each relay ampliﬁes and forwards the remaining undecoded layers.\nSuppose that the ﬁrst and second relays allocate portions ξP r and ζP r of their power to the decoded layers, respectively. Also, assume that the ﬁrst and second relays respectively de- code M and N layers out of the K transmitted layers. Without loss of generality, assume M ≥ N. Denote by α 2 l (resp. β 2 l ) the power allocated to the l\u2019th layer at the ﬁrst (resp. second) relay. The amplifying coefﬁcients are c 1 = \t U ( a r1 − Pr Ps ) ¯ ξP r a\nγ l for l = N + 1, ..., K. Note that channel conditions do not change during two consec- utive blocks of transmissions. The coding scheme is as follows. At time t, the ﬁrst relay sends K l =1 α l X l (t) while the other relay sends K l =1 β l X l (t + 1). At time t + 1, the ﬁrst and the second relays send K l =1 −α l X ∗ l (t + 1) and K l =1 β l X ∗ l (t), respectively.\n    \n   \nY (t)=h 1 K l =1 α l X l (t)+h 2 K l =1 β l X l (t + 1) +h 1 c 1 Z r 1 (t) + h 2 c 2 Z r 2 (t + 1) +Z(t),\nY (t + 1)= −h 1 K l =1 α l X ∗ l (t + 1)+h 2 K l =1 β l X ∗ l (t) −h 1 c 1 Z ∗ r 1 (t + 1) + h 2 c 2 Z ∗ r 2 (t) +Z(t + 1).\n(8) One may express a matrix representation for eq.

(9) The receiver starts decoding the code layers in order, from\nthe ﬁrst layer up to the highest layer that is decodable. To decode the l\u2019th layer, after decoding the ﬁrst l − 1 layers, the channels are separated into two parallel channels by multiply- ing both sides of eq. (9) by h\nh ∗ 2 β l h 1 α l .

Let deﬁne an upper-bound model by considering a full cooperation and power cooperation between the relays in the problem of interest (see ﬁg. 2). The upper-bound model is a dual-hop single-relay channel with the channel gains a r = a r 1 + a r 2 and a = a 1 + a 2 for the transmitter-relay link and the relay- destination link, respectively. As the optimum relaying strategy for dual-hop single-relay channels is DF, the throughput of this upper-bound model is given by\nThe most expected-rate of dual-hop single-relay channels has been studied in [6]. Here, only the ﬁnal solution is mentioned as\nI s (0) = P s , I r (0 |a r = y) = P r . \t (18) As the maximum transmission rate of the relay can not exceed its successfully decoded rate, the constraint on rate is\n1 + xI s (x) , ∀y. \t (19) The optimization problem of eq. (17) can be solved nu- merically using the algorithm proposed in [11]. Substituting F a r (x) = F a (x) = (1 + x)e −x in eq. (17), we come up with the upper-bound as follows, which does not lend itself to a closed form formulation.\nProposition 1 In parallel relay networks, the maximum expected-rate at the destination is bounded by\nsubject to the power and rate constraints eqs. (18) and (19), respectively.\nThe cutset-bound of the network results in a closed form expression, however is looser than the above upper-bound. Due to space limitations, we only summarize the results below.\nProposition 2 The cutset-bound of expected-rate in the par- allel relay network is speciﬁed by\nFigure 3 shows the maximum throughput and the maximum two-layer expected-rate of both relaying strategies and DF\npresented in [9], and compares them with the upper-bounds for −10dB ≤ P r ≤ 60dB and P s = 0dB. It can be seen from the curves that AF scheme outperforms DF scheme of [9] in terms of throughput for P r P s > 20dB, and in terms of expected- rate for P r P\n> 30dB, with lower complexity. As shown in ﬁg. 3, DF and AF are both outperformed by the proposed DAF. Note that the rates are expressed in nats. Figure 3 shows that when the ratio of the relay power to the source power is low, the obtained upper-bound is tight. Note that non of the proposed relaying strategies meets the upper-bound when the ratio of the relay power to the source power is high. The reason is that the obtained upper-bounds are based on full cooperation between the relays (see ﬁg. 2). Therefore the ﬁst hop in the upper- bound model is stronger than that of the proposed schemes of the network, while thanks to distributed space-time codes, their second hop have the same ability. When the ratio of the relay power to the source power is high, the ﬁrst hop causes a real bottleneck, in which the upper-bound model is stronger than the proposed schemes.\nThe main goal of the paper is to propose simple, efﬁcient, and practical relaying schemes to increase the average achiev- able rate at the destination in dual-hop parallel relay networks with Rayleigh block fading links and uninformed transmitters. To this end, a hybrid decode-amplify-forward relaying scheme, in conjunction with the broadcast approach, were proposed. The maximum achievable throughput and expected-rates of this scheme and also the ON/OFF based amplify-forward relaying strategy were derived and numerically compared with two obtained upper-bounds."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"B.
