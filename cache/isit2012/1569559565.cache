Upper bounds to the probability of error of optimal codes for pure-state channels were obtained by Burnashev and Holevo [1] that are the equivalent of the so-called random coding bound obtained by Fano [2] and Gallager [3] and of the expurgated bound of Gallager [3] for classical channels. The expurgated bound was then extended to general quantum channels by Holevo [4]. The formal extension of the random coding bound expression to mixed states is conjectured to represent an upper bound for the general case but no proof has been obtained yet (see [1], [4]).\nIn this paper, a sphere packing bound for classical-quantum channels is derived. The quantum case is related to the classical one by means of the Nussbaum-Szkoła mapping, introduced in [5] and central to the proof of the converse part of the quantum Chernoff bound (see [6] for more details). This allows us to extend to the quantum case the Shannon-Gallager- Berlekamp generalization of the Chernoff bound introduced in [7] (in its converse part). Then, the proof of the sphere packing bound used in [7] is adapted to the quantum case. This demonstrates the power of the method developed in [7]. Due to space limitation, this paper only includes the main derivation of the results; technical details and additional comments can be found in an extended version of this paper [8].\nIn this section, the converse part of the Shannon-Gallager- Berlekamp bound for classical binary hypothesis testing [7, Th. 5] is extended to the case of quantum state discrimination. This result will then be used in the next section to derive the sphere packing bound.\nLet and ς be two density operators in a Hilbert space H and consider the problem of binary hypothesis testing between\nnon-disjoint supports, for otherwise the problem is trivial. The decision has to be taken based on the result of a measurement that can be identiﬁed with a pair of positive operators { 1 − Π, Π}, where 0 < Π < 1, associated respectively to and ς. The probability of error given that the system is in state or ς is respectively\nP e| = Tr Π and P e|ς = Tr(1 − Π)ς. \t (1) Remark 1: This choice of notation is motivated by the fact\nthat our states and ς do not play the role of the states that are usually indicated with ρ and σ in the literature. For example, when comparing Theorem 1 below with the results in [6], we should interpret our quantities with the correspondences\n= ρ ⊗N and ς = σ ⊗N in mind. Here, however, we will apply the theorem to more general cases where and ς are tensor products of N not necessarily identical states and, in this sense, Theorem 1 is more general than the results in [6].\nFollowing [7, Sec. 3], for any real s in the interval 0 < s < 1, deﬁne the quantity\nµ(s) = log Tr 1−s ς s \t (2) and let then by deﬁnition\nTheorem 1 (Quantum Shannon-Gallager-Berlekamp Bound): Let , ς be density operators with non-disjoint supports, let Π be a measurement operator for the binary hypothesis test between and ς, let the probabilities of error P e| , P e|ς be deﬁned as in (1) and µ(s) be deﬁned as in (2)-(3). Then, for any 0 < s < 1, either\n8 exp µ(s) − sµ (s) − s 2µ (s) \t (4) or\n(5) Proof: This theorem is essentially the combination of the\nmain idea introduced in [5] for proving the converse part of the quantum Chernoff bound and of [7, Th. 5], the classical version of this same theorem. Since some intermediate steps of those proofs are needed, we unroll the details here for the reader\u2019s convenience.\nWe proceed as in [6]. Let the spectral decomposition of and ς be respectively\nwhere {|x i } and {|y j } are orthonormal bases. First observe that, from the Quantum Neyman-Pearson Lemma ([9], [10]), it sufﬁces to consider orthogonal projectors Π. So, one has Π = Π 2 = Π1Π = j Π|y j y j |Π. Symmetrically, we have that ( 1 − Π) = i (1 − Π)|x i x i |(1 − Π). Hence, one has\nP e| = Tr Π \t (7) =\nP e|ς = Tr(1 − Π)ς \t (9) =\nUsing the fact that |a| 2 + |b| 2 ≥ |a + b| 2 /2 for any two complex numbers a, b, we ﬁnd that for all (i, j)\nNow, following [5], consider two probability distributions deﬁned by the Nussbaum-Szkoła mapping\nThese two probability distributions are both strictly positive for at least one pair of (i, j) values, since we assumed , ς to have non-disjoint supports. Furthermore, they have the nice property of allowing for µ(s), as deﬁned in (2), the expression\nµ (s) = E Q s [log(P 2 /P 1 )] \t (16) µ (s) = Var Q s [log(P 2 /P 1 )] , \t (17)\nwhere the subscript Q s means that the expected values are with respect to the probability distribution Q s . Hence, if one deﬁnes the set\nthen Y s Q s (i, j) > 1/2, by Chebyshev\u2019s inequality. It is easily checked, using the deﬁnitions (15) and (18), that for each (i, j) ∈ Y s the distribution Q s satisﬁes\nHence, in Y s , Q s (i, j) is bounded by the minimum of the two expressions on the right hand side of (19) and (20). If we call η 1 the coefﬁcient of P 1 (i, j) in (19) and η 2 the coefﬁcient of P 2 (i, j) in (20), then we obtain\nNow note that the last expression, by the deﬁnition of P 1 and P 2 in (13), exactly equals the sum in (12). So, with the selected values of η 1 and η 2 we have η 1 P e| + η 2 P e|ς > 1/4. But, obviously, η 1 P e| + η 2 P e|ς ≤ 2 max{η 1 P e| , η 2 P e|ς }. Hence, either P e| > η −1 1 /8 or P e|ς > η −1 2 /8, concluding the proof.\nFollowing [4], consider a classical-quantum channel with an input alphabet of K symbols {1, . . . , K} with associated density operators S k , k = 1, . . . , K in a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space H. The N -fold product channel acts in the tensor product space H ⊗N of N copies of H. To a code- word w = (k 1 , k 2 , . . . , k N ) is associated the signal state S w = S k 1 ⊗ S k 2 · · · ⊗ S k N . A block code with M codewords is a mapping from a set of M messages {1, . . . , M } into a set of M codewords w 1 , . . . , w M . A quantum decision scheme for such a code is a collection of M positive operators {Π 1 , Π 2 , . . . , Π M } such that Π i ≤ 1. The rate of the code is deﬁned as R = (log M )/N .\nThe probability that message m is decoded when message m is transmitted is P (m |m) = Tr Π m S w m and the total probability of error after sending message m is P e,m = 1 − Tr (Π m S w m ). We then deﬁne the maximum probability of error of the code P e,max = max m P e,m and, for any positive R and integer N , we deﬁne P (N ) e,max (R) as the minimum maximum error probability over all codes of block length N and rate at least R.\nFor rates R smaller than the capacity of the channel, P (N ) e,max (R) goes to zero exponentially fast in N . The reliability function of the channel is deﬁned as 1\n− 1 N\nThe purpose of this section is to adapt the proof of the sphere packing bound in [7, Sec. IV] to the case of quantum channels. This results in the following theorem.\nTheorem 2 (Sphere Packing Bound): For all positive rates R and all positive ε,\nwhere E sp (R) is deﬁned by the relations E sp (R) = sup\nRemark 2: For some channels, the function E sp (R) can be inﬁnite for R small enough. The role of the arbitrarily small constant ε is only important for one single value of the rate R = R ∞ , which is the inﬁmum of the rates R such that E sp (R) is ﬁnite.\nProof: We follow closely the proof given in [7, Sec. IV] for the classical case. Some steps are clearly to be adapted to the quantum case and, since that proof is quite complicated, it would not be easy to explain how to do that without at least repeating the main steps of the proof. Hence, for the reader\u2019s convenience, we prefer to go through the whole proof used in [7] directly speaking in terms quantum channels and trying to simplify it as much as possible in view of the weaker results that we are pursuing with respect to [7, Th. 5] (we are here only interested in the asymptotic ﬁrst order exponent, while in [7], bounds for ﬁxed M and N are obtained).\nThe key point is using Fano\u2019s idea [2, Sec. 9.2] of bounding the probability of error for at least one codeword w m by studying a binary hypothesis testing problem between S w m and a dummy state f , which is only used as a measure for the decision operator Π m .\nHere, we simplify the problem using the fact that for the study of E(R) we can only consider the case of constant composition codes (see [2] [7]). This observation clearly holds also for classical-quantum channels, since it stems from the fact that the number of different compositions only grows polynomially in N , while the number of codewords grows exponentially. Hence, let c k be the number of occurrences of symbol k in each word and deﬁne then q k as the ratio c k /N , so that the vector q = (q 1 , q 2 , . . . , q K ) is obviously a probability distribution over the K input symbols.\nLet now f be a state in H ⊗N . We will ﬁrst apply Theorem 1 using one of the codewords as state and f as state ς. This will result in a trade-off between the rate of the code R and the probability of error P e,max , where both quantities will be parameterized in the parameter s, a higher rate being allowed if a larger P e,max is tolerated and vice-versa. This trade-off depends of course on q and f . We will later pick f properly so as to obtain the best possible bound for a given R valid for all compositions q.\nFor any m = 1 . . . , M , consider the binary hypothesis testing between S w m and f . We assume that S w m and f have non-disjoint supports and deﬁne the quantity\nApplying Theorem 1 with = S w m , ς = f and Π = 1 − Π m , we ﬁnd that for each s in 0 < s < 1, either\n(30) or\nNote now that Tr [( 1 − Π m ) S w m ] = P e,m ≤ P e,max for all m. Furthermore, since M m=1 Π m ≤ 1, for at least one value of m we have Tr [Π m f ] ≤ 1/M = e −N R . Choosing this particular m, we thus obtain from the above two equations that either\nP e,max > 1 8 exp µ(s) − sµ (s) − s 2µ (s) \t (32) or\nR < − 1 N\n(33) In these equations we begin to see the aimed trade-off\nbetween the rate and the probability of error. It is implicit here in the deﬁnition of µ(s) that both equations depend on S w m and f . Since m has been ﬁxed, we can drop its explicit indication and use simply w in place of w m from this point on. We will now call R(s, S w , f ) the right hand side of (33). This allows us to write µ (s) in (32) in terms of R(s, S w , f ) so that, taking the logarithm in equation (32), our conditions can be rewritten as either\nR < R(s, S w , f ) \t (34) or\nAt this point, we exploit the fact that we are considering a ﬁxed composition code. Since we want our result to depend only on the composition q and not on the particular sequence w, we choose f so that the function µ(s) also only depends on the composition q. We thus choose f to be the N -fold tensor power of a state f in H, that is f = f ⊗N . With this choice, in fact, we easily check that, if w has composition q,\nThus, µ(s) actually only depends on the composition q and on f , and not on the particular w. It is useful to remember that since we assumed the supports of f and S w to be non- disjoint, the supports of S k and f are not disjoint if q k > 0, so that all terms in the sum are well deﬁned. Setting\nµ k,f (s) := log Tr S 1−s k f s \t (38) we thus have\nµ (s) = N \t q k µ k,f (s). \t (40) With the same procedure used to obtain (17) using the Nussbaum-Szkoła mapping (13), we see that for ﬁxed s and f , µ k,f (s) is a variance of a ﬁnite random variable and it is thus a ﬁnite non-negative real number. Taking the largest of these numbers over k, say C(s, f ), we ﬁnd that\nµ (s) ≤ N C(s, f ). \t (41) We also observe that since µ k,f (s) ≥ 0 for all k, µ k,f (s) is convex in s for all choices of f , a fact that will be useful later.\nThe essential point here is that the contribution of µ(s) and µ (s) in our bounds will grow linearly in N , while the contribution of µ (s) will only grow with\nN . Hence, the terms involving µ (s) become unimportant for large N . A formalization of this fact, however, is tricky. In [7] the effect of µ (s) in the classical case is dealt with by bounding s 2 µ k,f (s) by a constant uniformly over s and f , which allows the authors to proceed in deriving a bound on P e,max for all ﬁxed M and N .\nIn our case, this procedure cannot be applied in a simple way (see [8] for details on the reasons) and we have to take at this point a slightly different approach, which will allow us to ﬁnd a bound on E(R) using the asymptotic regime N → ∞. Simplifying again the notation in light of the previous observations, let us write R(s, q, f ) for R(s, S w , f ). Using the obtained expression for µ(s), our conditions are either\nR < R(s, q, f ) \t (42) or\n1 N\nNow we come to the most critical step. Given a rate R, we want to bound P e,max for all codes. Here, we should choose s and f optimally depending on q and R, but we should then optimize the composition q in order to have a bound valid for all codes. This direct approach, even in the classical case, turns out to be very complicated (see [2, Sec. 9.3 and 9.4, pag. 188-303] for a detailed and however instructive analysis). The authors in [7] thus proceed in a more synthetic way by stating the resulting optimal f and q as a function of s and then proving that this choice leads to the desired bound. Here, we will follow this approach showing that the same reasoning can be applied also to the case of quantum channels. It is important to point out that it is not possible to simply convert the quantum problem to the classical one using the Nussbaum-Szkoła mapping (13) directly on the states S k and f and then using the construction of [7, eqs. (4.18)-(4.20)] on the obtained classical distributions. In fact, in (13), even if one of the two states is kept ﬁxed and only the other one varies, both distributions vary. Thus, even if f is kept ﬁxed, the effect of varying S k for the different values of k would not be compatible with the fact that in [7, eq. (4.20)] a ﬁxed f s\n(in that notation) is deﬁned, which is not supposed to depend on k. Fortunately, it is instead possible to exactly replicate the steps used in [7] by correctly reinterpreting the construction of f and q in the quantum setting.\nand call q s = (q 1,s , . . . , q K,s ) the choice of q that maximizes this expression. As observed by Holevo 2 [4, eq. (38)], q s satisﬁes the conditions\n(45) where\nFurthermore, equation (45) is satisﬁed with equality for those k with q k,s > 0, as can be veriﬁed by multiplying it by q k,s and summing over k.\nSince we can choose s and f freely, we will now tie the operator f to the choice of s, using f s for f . We only have to keep in mind that µ (s) and µ (s) are computed by holding f ﬁxed. Note further that we fullﬁll the requirement that f and S k have non-disjoint supports, since the left hand side in (45) must be positive for all k.\nAs in [7, eqs (4.21)-(4.22)], we see that, using f s in place of f in the deﬁnition of µ k,f (s), we get\nwith equality if q k,s > 0. Here, we have used the deﬁnitions (46), (28) and (27), and the the fact that q s maximizes (44). Thus, with the choice of f = f s , equations (42) and (43) can be rewritten as (for each s) either\nR < R(s, q, f s ) \t (52) or\n1 N\nUsing the same procedure used in [7, pag. 100-102], invok- ing the strict convexity of Tr(α 1/(1−s) ) in α for 0 < s < 1, it can be proved that R(s, q, f s ) is a continuous function of s. Thus, for ﬁxed R, we can only have three possibilities:\nOur conditions are slightly different from those in [7] due to the fact that we have not been able to bound uniformly the second derivatives µ k,f\n(s) for s ∈ (0, 1). For this same reason, dealing with these possibilities for a ﬁxed code is more complicated in our case than in [7]. Thus, we have to depart slightly from [7]. Due to space limitation, we can give here only a concise explanation that should be sufﬁcient when integrated with [7], the interested reader can ﬁnd more precise technical details in [8].\nInstead of considering a ﬁxed code of block length N , con- sider sequences of codes. From the deﬁnition of E(R) in (24), it is obvious that there exists a sequence of codes of block- lengths N 1 , N 2 , . . . , N n , . . . , and rates R 1 , R 2 , . . . , R n , . . . such that R = lim n R n and\nEach code of the sequence will in general have a different composition q n but must anyway fall in one of the above three cases. Thus, one of those cases is veriﬁed inﬁnitely often. Since the compositions q n are in a bounded set, there exists a subsequence of codes such that q n converge to, say, ¯ q. Thus, we can directly assume this subsequence is our own sequence and safely assume that q n → ¯ q.\nSuppose now that case (1) is veriﬁed inﬁnitely often. Thus, for inﬁnitely many n, there is an s = s n in the interval 0 < s < 1 such that R n = R(s, q n , f s n ). Hence, since the values s n are in the interval (0, 1), there must exists an accumulation point for the s n in the closed interval [0, 1]. We will ﬁrst assume that an accumulation point ¯ s exists satisfying 0 < ¯ s < 1. A subsequence of codes then exists with the s n tending to ¯ s. Let this subsequence be our new sequence. We can ﬁrst substitute R(s n , q n , f s n ) with R n in (53). Letting then n → ∞, we ﬁnd that R n → R and the last two terms on the right hand side of (53) vanish. Hence, we obtain\n= E sp (R). \t (58) Suppose now that either case (2) above is veriﬁed inﬁnitely\noften, or that case (1) is with the only accumulating point ¯ s = 0 for the values s n . Given any ε 1 > 0, for any ﬁxed\ns ∈ [ε 1 , 1) we must have R(s, q n , f s ) ≤ R n inﬁnitely often. Since condition (52) is not satisﬁed, (53) must be satisﬁed inﬁnitely often for any ﬁxed s ∈ [ε 1 , 1). Making n → ∞ we can get rid again of the last two terms in (53) and have\nLetting then ε 1 → 0, we can let s → 0 as well and ﬁnd that E(R) ≤ 0. Thus, surely E(R) ≤ E sp (R) proving the theorem in this case (see [8] for more details here).\nSuppose ﬁnally that either case (3) above is veriﬁed in- ﬁnitely often, or that case (1) is with the only accumulating point ¯ s = 1 for the values s n . Given any ε 1 > 0, for all s ∈ (0, 1 − ε 1 ], the inequality R n < R(s, q n , f s ) is veriﬁed inﬁnitely often, so that we can take this time the limit n → ∞ in (52) and (54). Proceeding exactly as in [7], we can then use the convexity of µ k,f (s) and (51) to prove that\nR ≤ 1 − s s\n1 − s \t (60) for all s ∈ (0, 1 − ε 1 ]. Setting ρ = s/(1 − s) and ρ 1 = (1 − ε 1 )/ε 1 , this implies that for any ε 2 > 0,\nwhich is arbitrarily large for any ε 2 if ε 1 is small enough. This proves that E sp (R − ε 2 ) is unbounded for arbitrarily small ε 2 and thus surely E(R) ≤ E sp (R − ε 2 ), concluding the proof."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M. V. Burnashev"},{"name":"A. S.
