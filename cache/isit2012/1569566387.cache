Indeed, in half duplex relay networks, an additional dimension of optimization comes into play: scheduling the relay states, i.e., whether each relay transmits ( T ) or listens (L) at any given time instance [5]. For exam- ple, for the N -relay diamond network in Fig. 1, there exist 2 N possible combinations of L, T states, and any capacity achieving strategy would need to optimize for how long each of these occurs.\nIn this paper, we consider half-duplex diamond networks [7]. Our position is the following: at least for small diamond networks, there might be no need for such an exponential size optimization. We base this claim on two observations. First, following the network simpliﬁcation approach of [4], we show that even very simple schedules that use only two states and employ point-to-point connections (no broadcasting and no multiple access) can (approximately) achieve a rate that is a signiﬁcant multiplicative fraction of the capacity of the whole network. This multiplicative fraction is independent of the strength of the links in the 2 and 3 relay diamond networks and the operating SNR. Second, the approximately optimal schedule may have at most N + 1 active states, instead of the possible 2 N . For example, for 2 relays, although 4 states are possible, at most 3 are employed (this directly follows from the work in [2]), while for 3 relays, only 4 out of the 8 possible states are employed. This conjecture is supported by experimental results, as well as analytic proofs for some special cases.\nThe aim of this paper is to show that even with reduced schedule complexity, signiﬁcant rates are achievable for small\nhalf-duplex diamond networks. In the rest of the paper: Sec- tion II provides the framework of our work, i.e., the network model, a simple approximation to the capacity of the half- duplex diamond network, the rate achieved by the simple strategies of interest and a Linear Programming (LP) problem formulation; Section III establishes lower bounds on the rates achieved by the simple strategies; Section IV presents our conjecture regarding the linear number of active states in the (approximately) optimal schedule.\nWe consider the Gaussian N -relay diamond network where a source S transmits information to a destination D with the help of half-duplex relays. At any given time t, each relay R i can either listen ( L) or transmit (T ), but not both; we denote by M i [t] ∈ {L, T } its state. We denote by M s [t] and M d [t] the states of the source and the destination, respectively.\nLet X s [t] be the signal transmitted by S at time t, X i [t] be the signal transmitted by relay R i , Y d [t] and Y i [t] the signals received by D and R i , respectively. Then\nY i [t] = h is X s [t] + Z i [t] when M i [t] = L = 0 when M i [t] = T\nh id X i [t] + Z[t] when M d [t] = L = 0 when M d [t] = T\nwhere h is , h id are the complex channel coefﬁcients between S and R i and R i and D, respectively. Z i [t] and Z[t] are independent and identically distributed white Gaussian random processes of power spectral density N 0 /2 Watts/Hz.\nThe power constraints for the source and all the relays are ﬁxed to P . We can then calculate the individual link capacities from S to R i as R is = log(1 + |h is | 2 P ) and from R i to D as R id = log(1 + |h id | 2 P ). [N ] represents the set {1, 2, · · · , N } and the relays are ordered such that R is ≥ R js for i < j. Finally, unless otherwise stated, the term \u201cconstant\u201d will mean\na quantity that depends only on the number of relays and is independent of the channel SNRs.\nFor half-duplex relay networks, the capacity depends not only on the strength of the channel coefﬁcients, but crucially also on the L-T scheduling. Let m ∈ M = {L, T } N denote a particular state of the relays and let L(m) and T (m) be the set of relays in listening and transmitting state in m, respectively. In a particular schedule, let p(m) denote the fraction of time the relays are in state m. Let C N hd be the capacity of the N - relay half-duplex diamond network. [6, Section VI] derives an upper bound on the capacity of arbitrary half-duplex wireless networks, which combined with the simpliﬁcation approach developed in [4] for diamond networks, yields the following upper bound on C N hd .\nLemma 2.1: We have C N hd ≤ C N LP + G(N) where G(N) = N + 3 log N − 2.75 and C N LP = max\nThe minimization is over all the 2 N subsets Λ of the relay nodes [ N ] = {R 1 , . . . , R N } and the maximization is over all schedules p(.) such that m∈M p(m) = 1. Starting with the cutset-upper bound to the capacity of the network similar to [4], the main idea in the proof is to show that the values of the broadcast and multiple-access cuts can be bounded by the maximum capacity of the individual constituent links within a certain constant gap. Following [1], [6], we can also show that C N LP is achievable by quantize-map-and-forward scheme within an additive constant gap. This is because C N LP is smaller than the cutset-upper bound to the capacity of the network and these works show that the cutset-upper bound is achievable within a certain gap. Therefore, we get the following approximation for the capacity C N hd\nTheorem 2.2: For a N relay half-duplex diamond network, there exist constants G(N ) and G (N ) such that\nThus C N LP , which only depends on the individual capacities of the links {R is , R id }, can approximate C N hd upto constant additive terms.\nWe deﬁne simple strategies to be relaying strategies that use exactly two states and avoid broadcast at the source and multiple access at the destination. Concretely, we look at the rates achievable under the Decode-Forward scheme:\n1-relay simple strategy: Let C s1,i be the maximum achievable rate over the one hop network S-R i - D when the relay node R i decodes the source message, re-encodes and transmits it to D. Let p 1 , p 2 be the fraction of time R i is in the L and T state, respectively. Then\nSolving the maximization, we can easily conclude that C s1,i = R is R id /(R is + R id ). We deﬁne C s1 to be the maximum\nachievable rate by this strategy which uses decode and forward at a single relay, i.e.\n2-relay simple strategy: With two relays, we use the Mutihop-Decode-Forward (MDF) strategy as deﬁned in [2], [8]. A pair of relays R i and R j ( i < j) are operated in a complementary fashion, using only the two states {L, T } and {T, L}. Each of the relay performs decode-and-forward. Let p 1 , p 2 be the fraction of time ( R i , R j ) are in the states ( L, T ) and ( T, L) respectively. Then the maximum rate achieved by this strategy is given by\nNote that the ﬁrst term is the rate carried by the ﬁrst relay and the second term is the rate carried by the second relay. Assuming R is ≥ R js , the maximization can be solved to obtain ([2], [8])\n+ R id if R is R js < R id R jd = R id (R is + R jd ) R\nThe best achievable rate C s2 by this strategy is given by a maximization over all possible choices for the two relays, i.e.,\nFinally, suppose we can show that a particular relaying strategy achieves a rate C . Then the next result, which follows easily from Theorem 2.2, can be used to prove bounds on the rates achievable by our simple strategies.\nC N LP can be reformulated as a linear program as follows. LP1 : Maximize C\nThe 2 N variables of type p(m) have been numbered as p i with m i being the corresponding state. LP1 can be visualized in a matrix form as follows. (All vectors are column vectors)\nMaximize c T [p C] \t (LP1) A[p C] ≥ b; [p C] ≥ 0\nwhere the objective function vector c T is of size 1 ×(2 N +1), with all zero entries except the last one which is +1. A is a (2 N + 1) × (2 N + 1) matrix with\n= −1 for 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 N ; i = 2 N + 1 = −1 for k = 2 N + 1; 1 ≤ i ≤ 2 N = 0 for k = 2 N + 1; i = 2 N + 1\nwhere Λ( k) is the k-th subset of [N ]. b is a (2 N + 1) × 1 vector with all zero entries except the last one which is - 1. The variable vector [ p C] consists of the 2 N variables {p 1 , p 2 , · · · , p 2 N } and the (approximate) capacity variable C. The dual of LP1, denoted by DLP1, is a minimization problem deﬁned as follows.\nMinimize c T [p d C d ] \t (DLP1) A[p d C d ] ≤ b; [p d C d ] ≥ 0\nThe deﬁnitions of A, b, c are the same as above and [p d C d ] is the corresponding variable vector in the dual program.\nIn [4], it was shown that for full-duplex N -relay diamond networks, we can always ﬁnd a k-relay subnetwork that ap- proximately achieves k k+1 fraction of the full-duplex network capacity within an additive constant factor; for half-duplex, this implies the following lemma.\nLemma 3.1: For a N -relay half-duplex diamond network, there exist a k relay subnetwork that approximately achieves\nk 2(k+1) of the capacity of the whole network within constant additive factors.\nTherefore, a 1-relay subnetwork can approximately achieve 1/4 and a 2 relay subnetwork 1/3 of the network\u2019s capacity for any N . Network simpliﬁcation [4] for half-duplex relays involves both using fewer relays and fewer number of states in the schedule. Therefore, what we show below can be thought of as improved simpliﬁcation bounds for N = 2 and N = 3.\nAs shown in [2], the linear program for C 2 LP can be solved exactly to obtain closed form expressions. Using them, we can prove the following result.\nLemma 3.2: For a 2-relay half-duplex diamond network, for some constants c 1 , c 2 ,\nProof: We show that C s1 ≥ 1 2 C 2 LP and C s2 ≥ 8 9 C 2 LP , whence the result follows from Lemma 2.3. For brevity, assume {R 1s , R 2s , R 1d , R 2d } = {a, b, c, d}. Note that a ≥ b. We will show the proofs for the case ( ab < cd). The other cases are similar. In this case, we have\nHence, C s1 = max{C s1,1 + C s1,2 } ≥ 1 2 C 2 LP . For the other claim, since there are only two relays, C s2 = C s2,12 . For the case of ( ab < cd), we have\nwhere f 1 (a, b, c) = a 2 b − ab 2 + a 2 c − 8abc + 8b 2 c + ac 2 . Writing f 1 as a quadratic expression in c, we have\nlook at its discriminant as a function of a, b. We have Δ a,b = (a 2 − 8ab + 8b 2 ) 2 − 4a(ab(a − b))\nThe multiplicative ratios are essentially the best we can obtain. Lemma 3.3: There exist 2-relay half-duplex diamond net-\nProof: For the ﬁrst claim, consider the network where R 1s = a, R 2s = b, R 1d = b, R 2d = a for some a, b ∈ R + , ( a > b). In this case, C s1 /C 2 LP = ab/(a+b) 2ab/(a+b) = 1/2. For the second claim, consider the network with R 1s = 2a, R 2s = a, R 1d = a, R 2d = ka for some k > 2. Then, plugging in the expressions for capacities, we have\nTo summarize, we have shown that for the 2-relay diamond network, we can universally achieve approximately 50% of the capacity using the 1-relay simple strategy and 88% by using the 2-relay simple strategy, independent of the channel SNRs. B. 3 Relay Antisymmetric Networks\nFor the case of N = 3 relays, it is difﬁcult to obtain closed form expressions for C 3 LP involving the six terms ( R 1s , R 2s , R 3s , R 1d , R 2d , R 3d ). We distinguish the relay net- works according to the order of the relative values of these capacities. Assuming that R 1s ≥ R 2s ≥ R 3s , the R id values can occur in six possible permutations. Although bounds can be obtained for each of the cases separately, we present here the results for the special case of antisymmetric networks where R 1s ≥ R 2s ≥ R 3s and R 1d ≤ R 2d ≤ R 3d .\nLemma 3.4: For the anti-symmetric 3-relay half-duplex di- amond network, for some constants c 3 , c 4 ,\nProof: To prove the result we show that C s1 ≥ 1 3 C 3 LP and C s2 ≥ 1 2 C 3 LP whence the result follows from Lemma 2.3.\nRedeﬁne {R 1s , R 2s , R 3s , R 1d , R 2d , R 3d } = {a, b, c, d, e, f}. and let x = max{d, e}, y = max{e, f }, z = max{d, f }, t = max{d, e, f}. For the anti-symmetric network, a ≥ b ≥ c and d ≤ e ≤ f . Hence x = e and y, z, t = f . The LP1 matrix for the network is shown below.\nWe will construct three upper bounds to the optimum value of this program by picking three different dual feasible solutions. They are\nThe third one ¯ β d is deﬁned as follows. When e = d or b = c, ¯ β d = [0, 0, 0, e − d\nb − c e − d + b − c , 0, (b + d)(e − d) + (c + d)(b − c)\nb + d depending on the parameter values. It can be veriﬁed that these three solutions are dual feasible and hence by weak duality [3] their objective values are upper bounds to C 3 LP . Hence, α 0 , β 0 , γ 0 ≥ C 3 LP , which implies min {α 0 , β 0 , γ 0 } ≥ C 3 LP .\nThis can be shown by expanding the terms and using the fact that a ≥ b ≥ c and d ≤ e ≤ f . Therefore\nwhich implies that C s1 ≥ 1 3 C 3 LP . Now for the second claim, let us consider the pairs of relays ( R 1 , R 2 ) and (R 2 , R 3 ). If C = C s2,12 + C s2,23 , using the expressions above for the 2-relay simply strategy, we have\ne b\nIf a d ≥ e b ≥ c f C\nIf a d ≥ c f ≥ e b C\nwhere n 1 , n 2 , n 3 , d 1 , d 2 , d 3 are polynomials in ( a, b, c, d, e, f ) and the last inequalities in each of the three cases follows from substitution and expansion of terms and using the fact that a ≥ b ≥ c and d ≤ e ≤ f . Therefore C s2,12 + C s2,23 ≥ C 3 LP . Picking the maximum of the two pairs, we get\nThe best lower bound multiplicative ratios we have been able to establish are the following.\nLemma 3.5: There exist 3-relay half-duplex diamond net- works where\nProof: Consider the network a = kr, b = 3r, c = 3r, d = 2r, e = 5r, f = 5r for some k > 30, r > 0. For this case,\nTo summarize, we have shown that for the 3-relay antisym- metric diamond network, we can universally achieve approxi- mately 33% of the capacity using the 1-relay simple strategy and 50% by using the 2-relay simple strategy, independent of the channel SNRs.\nIn general, the optimal schedule in LP1 corresponding to C N LP can have 2 N active states; we here present our conjecture that in fact, there always exists an optimal schedule with a linear number of active states. If true, this offers a signiﬁcant reduction (from exponential to linear) to the number of states needed for optimal operation, making it more feasible to implement such schedules in practice.\nConjecture: For a N relay half-duplex diamond network, there exists a schedule that optimizes the value of C N LP and has at most N + 1 active states.\nExperimental results: Fig. 2 shows numerical evaluation results for LP1. We plot the average number of active states in the optimal schedule as a function of the number of relays N . The average is taken over several random instances of the networks, where the SNRs of the source to relay and relay to destination channels are chosen independently and uniformly\nat random from the interval [1 , 1000]. For each value of N , the maximum and the minimum number of active states is found to be N + 1 and 2, respectively.\nProof for special cases: For the case of N = 2 relays, the claim follows easily by directly evaluating the optimal schedule [2] and checking that there are at most three states. We have not been able to come up with a general proof for N > 2. In what follows, we prove the conjecture for a special case of N = 3. Redeﬁne {R 1s , R 2s , R 3s , R 1d , R 2d , R 3d } = {a, b, c, d, e, f} Consider the case when the point to point capacities of all the relay to destination links dominates those of the source to relay links or vice-versa.\nLemma 4.1: For a 3-relay half-duplex diamond network where min {d, e, f} ≥ max{a, b, c} or min{a, b, c} ≥ max{d, e, f}, the optimal solution for LP1 has exactly 4 non- zero states.\nProof: Assume min {d, e, f} ≥ max{a, b, c}. The matrix corresponding to LP1 is the same as the one mentioned in the proof of Lemma 3.4. Name the rows of the matrix as I 1 , · · · , I 9 and columns as J 1 , · · · , J 9 . Consider the sub- matrix S formed using rows I 1 , I 4 , I 7 , I 8 , I 9 and columns J 1 , J 2 , J 3 , J 4 , J 9 and the corresponding form of LP1 with equality.\nS[p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 C] = [0 0 0 0 − 1] This can be solved to get the following result.\nSince a ≥ b ≥ c, p 2 , p 3 , p 4 ≥ 0. Further, since min{d, e, f} ≥ max{a, b, c} = a, we have f = a + l 1 , e = a + l 2 , d = a + l 3 , for some l 1 , l 2 , l 3 ≥ 0. Therefore,\nSince a ≥ b ≥ c, Δ 1 ≥ 0 and C ≥ 0. If we deﬁne p = {p 1 , p 2 , p 3 , p 4 , 0, 0, 0, 0} and C is the same as above, then\nIn other words [ p C] is a feasible solution for LP1. We will now consider the dual program and solve for the submatrix of the dual consisting of columns J 1 , J 2 , J 3 , J 4 , J 9 and rows I 1 , I 4 , I 7 , I 8 , I 9 , which is the transpose of S considered above. Note that the dual variables in the DP1 correspond to the rows in LP1. The corresponding form of DLP1 with equality is\nS T [p d 1 p d 2 p d 3 p d 4 C] = [0 0 0 0 − 1] On solving, we get\nJ T 1 [p d C d ] = J T 2 [p d C d ] = J T 3 [p d C d ] = J T 4 [p d C d ] = 0 Again, it can be explicitly veriﬁed that this implies"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A.
