However, these papers assume an ideal medium-access-control (MAC) layer for contention resolution on the uplink feedback channel, and do not address the likely packet collisions due to a potentially large number of MUs attempting to send their feedback packets back to the base-station (BS).\nIn this paper, we consider a multi-packet reception model to resolve collisions from MUs. MUs with positive feedback de- cisions feed their channel states back to the BS simultaneously. The BS can reconstruct all the feedback packets successfully if and only if the random number of MUs feeding back is less than or equal to λ, which is the maximum number of packets that the BS can decode concurrently. The BS utilizes information contained in the decoded feedback packets to assign beams to MUs. We say that a collision occurs if the random number of MUs feeding back is greater than λ. In this case, all packets are destroyed together. We will derive the structure of the optimal homogenous threshold feedback policy that maximizes the ergodic downlink sum-rate under the peak feedback load constraint λ imposed by this channel model.\nThe studied model is general in a sense that λ = 1 gives us the slotted Aloha collision model [10], and λ > 1 gives us a special class of a multi-packet reception collision model called T -out-of-N channels [11], [12]. Such channels can be implemented by using T -out-of-N codes [13]. However, unlike most such channel models, this paper does not consider back-off and retransmission issues. Hence, a collision will lead to zero rate. This assumption helps to eliminate the BS from receiving expired information on the instantaneous channel states.\nOur contributions and the organization of the paper are as follows. We explain the multiple access technique for feedback, and formulate the optimization problem in Section II. Then, in Section III, we show that this is a quasi-convex optimization problem by analyzing the rate expression, and solve it to obtain a formula for the optimal feedback probabil- ity. Our results hold for most practical fading distributions such\nMU 1 MU 2 MU n\nFRP FRP FRP\n· · · · · ·\ntheir FPs in the kth mini-slot simultaneously. The values for τ and t can be communicated to the MUs at system initialization. The feedback acquisition process is pictorially represented in Fig. 1.\nIt is important to note that a MU having an SINR value above the threshold on two or more beams will end up sending more than one FP according our deﬁnition of the feedback policy. This can be considered as a waste of communication resources since the MUs can piggy-back the additional data with the ﬁrst FP. However, it has been shown and discussed in detail in [7] that this will not happen if the threshold value is above one (i.e., 0 [dB]), which holds for almost all practical communication scenarios.\nWe deﬁne the truncated SINR on beam m at MU i as ¯ γ m,i = γ m,i 1 {γ m,i ≥τ } , and ¯ Γ = (¯ γ m,i ) m ∈M,i∈N is the system-wide M -by-n truncated SINR matrix containing the truncated SINR values of all MUs in the system. Given a threshold value τ , Λ m ¯ Γ denotes the random number of MUs feeding back on beam m, or alternatively, the random number of FPs transmitted in mini-slot m. We have Λ m ¯ Γ =\n1 {γ m,i ≥τ } , and it is our performance measure along the feedback dimension.\nThe BS will decode the FPs with probability one to retrieve the SINR information if and only if the number of FPs transmitted in the respective mini-slot is less than the feedback constraint λ. On the other hand, a collision will occur and all packets will be lost with probability one if the number of FPs exceed λ. There will be zero rate on beam m if the BS has no SINR information regarding the respective beam. This happens on the overﬂow event, where more than λ MUs feed back, and also on the outage event, where no MU feeds back. The BS selects the MU with the highest SINR on each beam for downlink data transmission to maximize the instantaneous communication rate. Then, the downlink ergodic sum-rate achieved for a threshold value τ and a feedback limit λ is given by\nwhere r λ τ, ¯ Γ is the instantaneous sum-rate achieved for a given τ and λ, and the expectation is taken over the\nBy using this idea, we will further evaluate the downlink sum- rate through the following lemma.\nLemma 1: The ergodic sum-rate of the system in consider- ation is given by\nProof: First, consider the event A k = ¯ Γ |Λ 1 ¯ Γ = k , which is the event where exactly k MUs feed back on beam one. The probability of this event is p A k = n k p k (1 − p) n −k . Therefore, we can write\n− F (τ) 1 − F (τ)\nwhich is the cumulative distribution function of the maximum of k independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) SINR values given all of them are above τ . Substitution of (7) in (6) together with F (τ ) = 1 − p gives\nThe rate on beam one will be non zero only on events A k for 1 ≤ k ≤ λ. Since these are disjoint events, summing over the average rates achieved on each of these events gives us the ergodic rate on beam one, which completes the proof.\nThe proof of the quasi-concavity of rate over p requires some more effort since the quasi-concavity deﬁnition cannot be applied directly. Hence, we will analyze the ﬁrst derivative of R λ (p) as a function of p, which is formally obtained in the following lemma.\nLemma 2: The ﬁrst derivative of the sum-rate R λ (p) is given by\nProof: Using the Leibniz integral rule, we obtain an expression for the ﬁrst derivative of R 1 λ (p, A k ), which is R 1 λ (p, A k ) \u2032 = g k −1 (p) − g k (p) for k ≥ 2, and\n= M n(1 − p) n −1 log 1 + F −1 (1 − p) − g λ (p) , which completes the proof.\nwhich is strictly negative for any p ∈ (0, 1). Therefore, G 2 (p) is strictly decreasing. The behavior of G 1 (p) and G 2 (p) is illustrated in Fig. 2. 1 Hence, G 1 (p) and G 2 (p) intersect at a unique value of p, which implies that there is only one station- ary point of R λ (p) for p ∈ (0, 1). Since lim p →0 R \u2032 λ (p) > 0, R λ (0) = 0 and R λ (1) = 0, this stationary point corresponds to the global maximum of R \u2032 λ (p). These arguments also indicate that the sum-rate strictly increases up a point p ⋆ , and then, strictly decreases. Therefore, the sum-rate is a quasi-concave function of p, which completes the proof.\nIt is important to note that the proven quasi-concavity property of the sum-rate is distribution independent, and the result in Theorem 1 can be used to ﬁnd the optimal feedback probability for most practical fading distributions such as Rayleigh, Ricean and Nakagami. However, substituting for F in (11) using a particular fading distribution may not necessarily lead to a closed form expression for p ⋆ . In such cases, most of the common root ﬁnding algorithms can be easily used to ﬁnd the unique zero crossing since (11) is a strictly increasing function of p. This will still be much efﬁcient computationally, compared to doing a line search over p on (5). In the next section, we will provide some numerical evaluations and insights into our results using a Rayleigh fading channel model.\nFor this numerical study, we assume transmitted signals of unit power, and Rayleigh distributed channel fading coefﬁ- cients of unit power. Interested readers are referred to [3] for further details of the physical layer model. F , f and F −1 for this model are given in [9]. Firstly, we study the behavior of the sum-rate for different values of λ. As shown in Fig. 3, the sum-rate is quasi-concave over p, and is strictly increasing when λ = n, which is in line with our arguments above. We observe that the difference between the maximum sum-rates for λ = 10 and λ = n is very small. This observation is more clearly depicted in Fig. 4, where we have plotted the ratio\npair is below this boundary, then it is a feasible operating point, which means that the sum-rate can be achieved without violating the feedback constraint. However, a point strictly below the boundary is suboptimal in the sense that the same sum-rate can be achieved with strictly less feedback or a better sum-rate can be achieved while maintaining the same feedback level.\nIn this paper, we considered a multi-packet reception model on the uplink, where the BS can successfully decode the feedback packets if and only if the number of feedback packets received is less than a constraint λ. Using this model, we obtained a formula for the downlink sum-rate maximizing feedback probability for any given λ. We discussed the im- portance of our result using a Rayleigh fading channel model, and obtained the Pareto optimal boundary between feasible and infeasible feedback-rate pairs. A possible modiﬁcation of the problem set-up presented in this paper can be achieved by eliminating the TDMA process among the beams in the feedback phase. In this model, the feedback resource is shared between beams: we would have a single time slot with increased peak feedback capacity. The performance of this shared feedback model is currently under investigation."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"P. Viswanath"},{"name":"D. Tse"},{"name":"R.
