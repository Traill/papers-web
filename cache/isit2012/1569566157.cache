For a ﬁxed transmission rate, discrete input alphabets and no channel state information at the transmitter, optimal space-time codes (STCs) achieving both gains (full rate and full diversity) are well known. How- ever, the complexity of maximum likelihood decoding increases exponentially with the number of space and time dimensions of the STC. Despite praiseworthy efforts to reduce the decoding complexity, optimal STCs are not used in practice in the case of more than two transmit antennas because of complexity reasons. It is generally accepted that reducing the dimension of the STC leads to a reduced diversity order. We show that this is not true for coded communication, assuming the presence of an outer error-correcting code with any coding rate. We propose a new class of full-rate full-diversity STCs; more speciﬁcally, time- varying space-only codes. This new class is referred to as EMI codes. Full diversity is proven in terms of outage probability, for the case where the number of receive antennas is larger than or equal to the number of transmit antennas, and is numerically veriﬁed in terms of outage and word error probability using LDPC codes."},"body":{"text":"Channels with multiple antenna at in- and output (MIMO) have more degrees of freedom which can be used to increase spectral efﬁciency (through spatial multiplexing) and reliabil- ity (through diversity). We consider classical Rayleigh faded n × r MIMO channels, where n and r are the number of transmit and receive antennas, respectively. The maximum spectral efﬁciency under which the maximal diversity order rn is achievable is min(n, r) log 2 M , where M is the con- stellation size, achieving a multiplexing gain of min(n, r). When the spectral efﬁciency is taken constant, both diversity and multiplexing gains can be fully achieved simultaneously, through full-rate full-diversity space-time codes (STCs). STCs for uncoded communication, i.e., without outer code, have been designed by minimizing the pairwise error probability under maximum likelihood (ML) decoding (e.g. [1], [12], [15], [18]). For coded communication, STCs have been designed assuming a genie (e.g. [11]). An STC taking into account both criteria was proposed in [4].\nIn the worst case, without sphere decoding [20], the com- plexity of exhaustive ML decoding of a u ×v STC (coding over u space dimensions and v time dimensions) at the receiver scales as O(M uv ). Therefore, optimal n × n STCs may be too complex to decode, e.g. scaling as O(16 16 ) when 16 −QAM and n = 4. Orthogonal STCs [18] have a much\nlower detection complexity, but in general at the expense of a signiﬁcantly reduced bit rate. Considerable effort has been put in reducing the decoding complexity of non-orthogonal STCs. For example, the complexity of decoding squared 2 × 2 STCs for the 2 ×2 MIMO channel was said to be reduced to O(M 2.5 ) [14], [16]. However, the achieved complexity reductions are not valid for all STCs and all MIMO channels.\nWe add a new dimension to the quest for low-complexity STCs, by reducing the dimension of the STC itself, without compromising on rate or diversity. In the context of coded communication, i.e., assuming an error-correcting code with coding rate R c < 1, we prove that the outage probability 1 of an n × r MIMO channel with r ≥ n, can have full transmit diversity using time-varying n × 1 (i.e. space-only) STCs, limiting its dimension by a factor of n with respect to optimal STCs. Time-varying rotations were ﬁrst used by [21], where the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff has been analysed for Gaussian alphabets in a multihop scenario. This paper extends [5], where full diversity of this new class of STCs was proved for 2 ×2 MIMO channels. This work has been extended in [6], also including the case where r < n, including more detailed proofs and more numerical results.\nNotation: we write scalars, vectors and matrices as x, x and X. The Landau symbols f (n) = O(g(n)) and f (n) = Ω(g(n)) mean f (n) ≤ kg(n) and f(n) ≥ kg(n) for some positive k. The equation sign f (γ) . = g(γ), introduced in\nWe consider a point-to-point MIMO channel H = [h i,j ] ∈ C r×n with n transmit antennas and r receive antennas, where h i,j ∼ CN (0, 1) is the complex path gain from transmit antenna j to receive antenna i. We assume that all path gains are independent. The channel state information is perfectly known at the receiver side, but unknown at the transmitter side. The channel is assumed to vary slowly, so that it remains constant during the transmission of at least one codeword. Assuming a total of N c channel uses per codeword, the output of the matched ﬁlter at the destination is\nwhere µ t , ν t ∈ C r×1 , ζ t ∈ C n×1 and γ is the average signal- to-noise ratio per symbol (SNR) at each transmit antenna 2 .The additive white Gaussian noise vector ν t has i.i.d. entries, ν i,t ∼ CN (0, 1). The transmit vector ζ t belongs to Ω ζ and its components ζ j,t satisfy E [ |ζ j,t | 2 ] = 1, ∀ j, t. The overall received signal-to-noise ratio per information bit is denoted as\n= γ = RE b /N 0 nr , where R = log 2 ( |Ω ζ |)R c is the spectral efﬁciency and R c is the coding rate. The instantaneous mutual information I(ζ t ; µ t |H) depends on Ω ζ and the channel realization H.\nThe channel realization H can be decomposed by a singular value decomposition (SVD) as H = U ΣV \u2020 , where U ∈ C r×r and V ∈ C n×n are unitary matrices, uniformly distributed in the Stiefel manifold with respect to the Haar measure [13, Sec. 2.1.4] [7, Sec. 3.2], V \u2020 is the Hermitian transpose of V , and Σ ∈ R r×n is a diagonal matrix with the non-negative singular values σ i , i = 1, . . . , min(r, n) of H on its diagonal. Because H is known at the receiver, the following transformation can be performed,\nt + w t , t = 1, . . . , N c \t (2) where w t follows the same distribution as ν t . Because U \u2020 µ t is an invertible transformation, no information is lost, i.e., I(ζ t ; y t |Σ, V ) = I(ζ t ; µ t |H). The outage probability is expressed as\nwhere E t [.] is the temporal mean (assuming that N c → ∞). The SNR-exponent of the outage probability, known as the diversity order, is\nIn the case that r > n, then the last r − n received symbols in y t contain only noise due to the fact that the bottom r − n rows of Σ are zero (see Eq. (2)). Hence, when we consider r > n in the following, then, allowing an abuse in notation, y t , w t and Σ refer to the top n rows of the actual vectors y t , w t and Σ, respectively. As a result, a new n × n MIMO channel is obtained, with a different singular value distribution than that from a normal n × n channel. Therefore, we only consider n × n channels in the following (using the notation from Eq. (2)), but we use the actual singular value distribution.\nAn n × k STC (containing nk elements) contains k vectors ζ t . Stacking all columns of the n × k STC into the vector ¯ζ l , we can write ¯ ζ l as a linear transform of the symbol vector z l\nwhere the components of z l belong to an M -QAM con- stellation Ω z , i.e., z l,i ∈ Ω z , i = 1, . . . , nk. We denote m = n log 2 M , which is, on average, the maximal number of bits that can be conveyed per channel use.\nare n × n full-rate full-diversity STCs (hence k = n). The precoder P l = P is constant, has dimension n 2 and its elements are optimized to maximize the coding gain (see for example [1], [4], [11], [12], [15], [18]). As mentioned before, their detection is complex for increasing n.\nWe propose time-varying space-only STCs, hence k = 1 so that P l only has dimension n, but P l varies with l. Because the STC is space-only, the notation simpliﬁes: ζ t = P t z t , t = 1, . . . , N c , where z t,i ∈ Ω z , i = 1, . . . , n. We consider the Cartesian product of n constellations Ω z = (Ω z ) n , so that z t ∈ Ω z . We denote our new precoder type by the EMI code, where EMI (Ergodic Mutual Information) refers to the temporal mean of the mutual information.\nThe channel Eq. (2) is very similar to that of a parallel channel with precoding. We denote x t = V \u2020 ζ t , where x t ∈ Ω x , hence I(x t ; y t |Σ, V ) = I(ζ t ; y t |H). Inserting x t in Eq. (2), we have that\nt + w t , t = 1, . . . , N c , \t (6) where x t = V \u2020 P t z t = V t z t (this can model both our proposed time-varying space-only precoder P t as a ﬁxed space-only precoder P t = P ). Hence, Σ corresponds to the parallel channel, V t corresponds to the precoder and z t corresponds to the symbol vector that is transformed by the precoder. The parallel channel model with precoding is well known for the study of signal space diversity (SSD) (see [3] for uncoded and [9] for coded communication over parallel channels), where V t is a rotation matrix. In SSD, full transmit diversity is achieved when V t is chosen so that s t,i = 0, ∀ i, t, where s t = x \u2032 t − x t , x \u2032 t , x t ∈ Ω x , x \u2032 t = x t .\nDeﬁnition 1: We deﬁne bad precoders P bad as the set of precoders so that ∃ i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, x t , x \u2032 t = x t , satisfying x t,i = x \u2032 t,i or equivalently, s t,i = 0.\nThe main difference with the parallel channel with precod- ing is that the considered precoder V t is random for MIMO. At ﬁrst, consider a unitary but ﬁxed precoder P t = P , so that V t has the same distribution as V , hence V t is uniformly distributed in the Stiefel manifold with respect to the Haar measure. Because V t is ﬁxed, we drop all time indices t and denote V \u2032 = V t . As the precoder does not change the channel distribution, seen by the symbol vector z, it is well known that a ﬁxed space-only precoder does not achieve transmit diversity. However, from the parallel channel point of view, this may not seem obvious, as the probability of having bad precoders, V \u2032 ∈ P bad , is zero. In accordance with the terminology of parallel channels with precoding, we explain the loss of transmit diversity by deﬁning corrupt precoders.\nDeﬁnition 2: We deﬁne corrupt precoders P c as the set of precoders so that ∃ z, z \u2032 = z, satisfying |s i | ≤ γ −0.5 , ∀ i > 1.\nLemma 1: The probability that a random precoder falls in the set of corrupt precoders is\nLemma 2: In a point-to-point n × r MIMO ﬂat fading channel with a ﬁxed n × n precoder P t = P , there exists a coding rate R c < 1 where at most the receive diversity is achieved (i.e., d out ≤ r) due to corrupt precoders V \u2032 ∈ P c .\nFirst, let us study P out |V \u2032 =V l . As in [10], [19], we deﬁne the ordered normalized fading gains α i = − log σ 2 i log γ , α 1 ≥ α 2 ≥ . . . ≥ α n , where the joint distribution p(α) is given by [19]\nThe mutual information can be expressed as in Eq. (9) where f (α i , s i , w i ) = e −γ 1−αi |s i | 2 −2\ns i = (x i − x \u2032 i ) and R{.} takes the real part. The normalized fading gains α ∈ R n , but since we are interested in the SNR- exponent, we only consider the dominant region, α ∈ R n + (see [19, Theorem 4], [10]). In order to determine the diversity order (Eq. (4)), we can apply the dominated convergence theorem [10, App. 2], so that\nFor corrupt precoders, ∃ z = z c , z \u2032 = z c , satisfying |s i | ≤ γ −0.5 , ∀i > 1. In the case of a corrupt precoder, we observe that for large γ and i > 1, lim γ→∞ f (α i , s i , w i ) = 1 if α i > 0. For large γ, the instantaneous mutual information is\n \nO e −γ 1−αm , if α i < 1, ∀ i Ω e − ( 1 γ ) α1−1 , \t α 1 > 1\nIn the event that α ∈ B ǫ , the instantaneous mutual infor- mation is m − Ω e −γ −ǫ , where\nHence, there exists a coding rate so that the spectral efﬁciency mR c is always larger than or equal to the mutual information,\ngiven that α ∈ B ǫ . For this coding rate, the outage probability is\nNoting that P out ˙ ≥ 1 γ n−1 P out |V \u2032 =V l and following the same lines as in [19, Theorem 4], [9], we obtain the SNR-exponent\nThe inﬁnum is (r − n + 1)(1 + ǫ), which is achieved when α n = . . . = α 2 = 0 and α 1 = 1 + ǫ. This holds for each ǫ > 0, and the bound in Eq. (12) can be made tight taking the inﬁnum inf ǫ d out (ǫ) (see e.g. [9]), we obtain d out ≤ r.\nIn accordance with the terminology of parallel channels with precoding, the loss of transmit diversity is caused because the random precoder falls too often in the set of corrupt precoders, or more precisely, because the speed at which the probability to have a corrupt precoder goes to zero is too slow.\nWe propose to marginalize the effect of corrupt precoders by averaging the mutual information over all unitary precoders V t during the transmission of a codeword. Therefore, we let P t be uniformly distributed in the Stiefel manifold. Since V is unitary and independent of P t and the distribution of P t is invariant to unitary transformation, V t = V \u2020 P t is also uniformly distributed in the Stiefel manifold.\nProposition 1: In a point-to-point n × r MIMO ﬂat fading channel, using a coding rate R c < 1 and using n ×n precoders P t , randomly generated for each channel use, being uniformly distributed in the Stiefel manifold, full diversity is achieved.\nProof: Similarly to P c , we deﬁne a larger set S c , which is the set of precoders V t so that ∃ i, z, z \u2032 = z, satisfying |s i | 2 ≤ (log γ) −p , for any p > 0. The probability Pr(V t ∈ S c ) → 0 for large γ (see App. B). Denoting I(x t ; y t |Σ, V t ) as I(V t ), we can write E t [I(V t )] as\nthe sample mean (over V t , uniform in the Stiefel manifold) which is equal to the temporal mean because P t is randomly generated at each channel use. Thus, we have that\nP out = Pr(E t [I(V t )] ≤ R) ≤ Pr(I in ≤ R), \t (14) By deﬁnition of ¯ S c , |s i | > (log γ) −p , so that for large γ,\n \nΩ e − ( 1 γ ) αi−1 , α i > 1 O e −γ 1−αi , α i < 1.\nHence, if n i=1 1 {α i < 1 } ≥ 1 (1{.} is the indicator function), then I(V l ) → m for large γ. More speciﬁcally,\nso that I(V l |α ∈ A ǫ ) = m − O e −γ ǫ . Note that for large γ and R c = 1 − ǫ 2 , ǫ 2 > 0,\nIn other words, Pr (I in ≤ R) ≤ Pr( ¯ A ǫ ). Hence, for large γ and any ǫ, ǫ 2 > 0, the outage probability is upper bounded by Pr ( ¯ A ǫ ), where ¯ A ǫ = {α : n i=1 1 {α i ≥ 1 − ǫ} = n}. Following the same lines as before (or see [9], [19]),\nThe proposed code is denoted as EMI code or EMI- T code when P t is randomly generated at each channel use or only a ﬁnite number of times T during the transmission of a codeword, respectively. The convergence properties for increasing T are not discussed here because of the lack of space.\nWe compare the outage probability of the proposed EMI code with the outage probabilities of the Golden code [1] and the perfect STC [8]. To show the practical relevance, we include the word error rate (WER) performance of a simple regular (3, 30) LDPC code [17] of coding rate R c = 0.9 and block length N = 5760, where N = mN c . In all simulation results, Ω z = 4 −QAM, so that the spectral efﬁciency is R = 0.9 ∗ 2 ∗ n = n ∗ 1.8 bpcu.\nWe assume an n × n MIMO channel, where n = 2 (Fig. 1) and n = 3 (Fig. 2). In the legend of the Figs., \u201cOut\u201d refers to outage, and the other curves refer to the practical WER performance. In all cases, the loss of the EMI code to the optimal STCs is more or less 1.5 dB in terms of the outage probability. The EMI- 10 code performs 0.5 dB worse than the EMI code. The WERs of the LDPC codes suggest that the results with respect to the outage probabilities are maintained when using a practical error-correcting code.\nNote that the focus of this paper was on diversity and rate. The coding gain will be considered in future work.\nThrough a lossless transformation at the receiver, the MIMO channel is converted into a parallel channel with a random precoder V that depends on the channel realization. The new channel has an identical mutual information. Using this new channel model, we study the fundamental reason why full diversity is not achieved without space-time coding. A set of corrupt precoders, with a non-negligible probability of occurrence, causes the loss in transmit diversity order. Therefore, we propose a new full-diversity full-rate space- only code which we refer to as the EMI code. The latter averages the mutual information of the MIMO channel over all random precoders V , thereby marginalizing corrupt precoders. We prove that the new precoder achieves full diversity if an error-correcting code with coding rate R c < 1 is used. The EMI code is said to be full rate because n new symbols are transmitted each channel use, where n is the number of transmit antennas. The main asset of this new coding scheme is that its complexity of decoding is signiﬁcantly lower, as its dimension is n instead of n 2 , at the expense of a small loss in performance. The theory is corroborated in the numerical\nresults, using a coding rate R c = 0.9 and 10 rotations per codeword.\nBefore we determine the probability of corrupt precoders, we consider the following Lemma.\nLemma 3: Consider two independent random variable X and Y which are χ 2 -distributed with parameter 2a and 2b, respectively. Then the random variable\nProof: X ∼ Γ(a, θ = 2) ⇔ X ∼ χ 2 (2a). A property of Beta-distributions is that if X ∼ Γ(a, θ = 2) and Y ∼ Γ(b, θ = 2), then Z = X X+Y ∼ β(a, b).\nConsider v = V \u2032 z−z \u2032 ||z−z \u2032 || , so that s = ||z − z \u2032 ||v. We ﬁrst show that v is uniform in the Stiefel manifold S n,1 , which is the set of all v where v \u2020 v = 1; i.e. its density is constant for all v. Consider any v 2 in S n,1 . Consider R so that v 2 = Rv. Matrix R always exists; more speciﬁcally, R = V 2 V H 1 , where V 2 and V 1 are unitary matrices with v 2 and v on its ﬁrst column, respectively. Hence v 2 = RV \u2032 z−z \u2032 ||z−z \u2032 || , where RV \u2032 is uniformly distributed in S n,n , thus v 2 has the same distribution as v. As a consequence of the uniform distribution, it is shown in [7, Theorem 3.1] that v t can be constructed as\nBecause |g i | 2 ∼ χ 2 (2) and n i=2 |g i | 2 ∼ χ 2 (2(n − 1)) (up to a constant), we have that n i=2 |v i | 2 ∼ β(n − 1, 1) and |v i | 2 ∼ β(1, n − 1) by Lemma 3. Now we can determine Pr (P c ).\nPr (P c ) . = Pr( |s 2 | 2 ≤ γ −1 , . . . , |s n | 2 ≤ γ −1 ) \t (18) . = Pr( n\nwhere the ﬁrst equality is because the number of pairs z , z \u2032 is ﬁnite.\nwhere the ﬁrst inequality is because the number of pairs z , z \u2032 is ﬁnite and where (21) follows from |v i | 2 ∼ β(1, n − 1) (see App. A). Hence, for large γ, Pr(S c ) → 0."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"J.-C. Belﬁore"},{"name":"G. Rekaya"},{"name":"E.
