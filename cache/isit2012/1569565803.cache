With the increasing numbers of users, and the increasing data rates resulting from real-time wireless services such as audio and video download, the demands on wireless networks is exponentially increasing.\nThere are two main ﬂavours of CDMA, Frequency Hop- ping (FH) and Direct Sequence (DS). For details of CDMA networks, we refer the interested reader to the survey in the Spread Spectrum Communications Handbook by Simon et. al. [8] and for sequence construction methods we recommend the more recent survey [6] as well.\nIn this paper, we shall be concerned with the so-called \u201cspreading codes\u201d in DS-CDMA, and speciﬁcally their Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) properties, which also helps characterize the interference they present on different systems they may co-exist with, or helps characterize their suitability for communications in high-security applications, where pas- sive bandwidth monitors may want to scan for the presence of a communications signal. The motivation for studying triple correlation will be further discussed in Section II.A.\nFor the symbol alphabets of practical interest, such as the binary ({±1}) and quaternary ({±1, ±i} with i =\nalphabets, there are a number of existing sequence designs with good autocorrelation. In our paper from ISIT 2011 [2] we have started examining single sequences and sequence designs from the point of view of LPI properties via their triple correlation function. We continue this line of research in this paper.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Section II, we provide a brief overview of Galois ﬁeld arithmetic, after introducing some deﬁnitions and notation for general sequence designs, and we brieﬂy discuss the existing literature on triple cor- relation properties. In Section III we obtain new results on the triple correlation properties for some binary sequence families\u2013namely the gold-like sequences with quadratic linear span which form the Most Signiﬁcant Bit of the quaternary Family A design, and the binary bent function sequences of Olsen et al [7]. Section IV concludes the paper.\nWe consider a complex sequence of period (length) N , say x = (x(0), . . . , x(N − 1)) in C N .\nThere is a large literature dealing with sequence design and the applications of such sequences; see, e.g., [3], [6], [9] and the references therein.\nTraditionally, sequences with good correlation have also been investigated with respect to antijam properties, and low probability of intercept (LPI), low probability of detection (LPD) communications. In the context of current developments in wireless transmission, with more and more complicated signal structures, the LPI/LPD properties of sequences can be looked at from two points of view.\nA sequence with good LPI/LPD properties (difﬁcult to detect) is good in the crowded wireless environment, it affords some physical level security, and its interference to other systems, signal bearers, is mitigated.\nIn this section we ﬁrst deﬁne traditional and triple correla- tions (C x,y (τ ) and θ x (τ, δ) respectively).\nwhere z denotes the complex conjugate of z and ⊕ denotes addition modulo N.\nThe triple correlation is deﬁned analogously, but with two time lags instead of one. Even when we restrict ourselves to autocorrelations, the exact deﬁnition for complex signals is somewhat arbitrary, since any of the following two expressions (up to equivalence) is acceptable:\nDepending on the properties of the sequences under consid- eration, it is possible that one of other of these deﬁnitions make more sense. However, we shall not dwell on this any further since we shall only consider real-valued sequences in this paper.\nDeﬁnition 2. The (periodic) triple autocorrelation of a real valued sequence of length N is given by\nBefore proceeding further we review some standard results from ﬁnite ﬁeld arithmetic. Let q = p k be a power of a prime and let the ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements be denoted by F q . Then the trace function T r mk k (x) (which we denote by T r(x) for simplicity) is a mapping from the extension ﬁeld F q m = F p mk to the ﬁeld F q given by:\n(i) T r(ax + by) = aT r(x) + bT r(y), for all a, b ∈ F q , x, y ∈ F q m .\n(ii) T r(x q m ) = T r(x), for all x ∈ F q m . (iii) For any b ∈ F q we have\n(iv) Let a ∈ F q m . If T r(ax) = 0 for all x ∈ F q m then a = 0. Let α in F q m have multiplicative order q m − 1. A nonzero sequence (s(t)) t≥0 with elements from F q generated by the recursion corresponding to f (x) ∈ F q [x], the primitive poly- nomial which has α as its root is called a maximal length sequence. We shall call such sequences an m-sequences for brevity, where the \u201cm\u201d in the short name is unrelated to m, the exponent of q above. The sequence is completely determined\nby the initial values s(0), . . . , s(m − 1) and a recursion of order m, and is given by\nIf a = 0, then we get the all zero sequence. Otherwise the period is p m − 1 which is the maximal possible and the sequences in (1) are cyclic shifts of each other, since any nonzero a = α i for some 0 ≤ i ≤ q m − 2.\nIn typical LPI/LPD applications, the sequence designs used are carefully chosen in order to have favourable low off- peak correlation. Such designs can operate in complex radio environments of high noise, interference, jamming and other co-channel signals. All this makes the interception of such communications very difﬁcult, which motivates the designers of interception equipment to search for alternative higher- order techniques of sequence detection. The triple correlation enables the easier detection of the LPI/LPD signals\u2013since there are many peaks in the (τ, δ) plane.\nIt is thus of interest to advance the study of typical se- quences with good correlation properties with respect to triple correlation.\nThe triple correlation properties of maximal length se- quences were obtained by Warner et al [11] and were also discussed by the authors [2] who also obtained computational results on the triple autocorrelation of Legendre and GMW sequences and partial theoretical results on the triple autocor- relation of Gold sequences. This work is advanced here by providing full proofs of the triple autocorrelation of Gold and Legendre sequences, as well as those of the Gold-like MSB sequences of Family A. Finally, we remark that related work has appeared in [5] under the term \u201chigher order correlation\u201d.\nLegendre sequences have ideal autocorrelation since they are essentially the characteristic functions of cyclic Hadamard difference sets, whenever their length p ≡ 3 (mod 4). How- ever, it is not immediately clear how to analytically compute the Θ(τ, δ) distribution for them. In [2] we experimentally observed that, unlike the m-sequences x(t) of period 2 n − 1 which have a full peak for every nontrivial row and column in the triple correlation array {Θ x (τ, δ) : 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2 n − 2, 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2 n − 2}, i.e., ∀δ = 0, there is a unique τ = 0 (actually τ = log α (1 + α δ ) if the m-sequence has primitive characteristic polynomial M α (X)), Legendre sequences did not have a full-peak. We provide a short informal proof here. The Legendre sequence f (t) is deﬁned via the quadratic multiplicative character of the group Z ∗ p as f (x) = χ(x)\nwhen x ∈ Z ∗ p and by extending it to zero by χ(0) = 1. This immediately gives\nand since the Hasse-Weil theorem states that unless a polyno- mial of degree d over a ﬁnite ﬁeld F q is of the form c(h(x)) s then a multiplicative character sum for a character η of order s (here s = 2, and F q = Z p ), (which by deﬁnition is zero at x = 0 satisﬁes)\nHere we have three zeroes, when x = 0, x = −τ and x = −δ where the traditional character sum would have had value zero but we have deﬁned our f (x) to be 1 at those places, but this can only change the sum by a total of 6 [by changing from +1 to -1]. Hence we have:\nTheorem 1. The nontrivial triple correlation function of Legendre sequences satisﬁes the bound\nThus the Legendre sequences are less detectable than the other sequences discussed in this section, with respect to LPI/LPD techniques since maximum absolute value peaks (of 2 n − 1) in | Θ f (τ, δ) | don\u2019t occur for them.\nWe now consider the Θ(τ, δ) distribution for Gold se- quences. Some of this was covered in [2] but we provide it here for completeness. Note that if (g k (t)) = T r n 1 (α t+k +α at ) denotes a binary Gold sequence with period 2 n − 1 and with decimation a where gcd(a, 2 n − 1) = 1, with 0 ≤ k ≤ 2 n − 2, then we can write\nwhere we deﬁne χ[·] = (−1) T r n 1 (·) . Let\u2019s consider the off-peak correlations:\nCase 1 If exactly one of τ and δ is zero, then we obtain, e.g.,\nwhere w k is the Hamming weight of one period of the k th Gold sequence g k (t).\nCase 2 If both of τ and δ are nonzero and equal we get 2 n − 1 − w k again since the g k (t + τ ) and g k (t + τ ) terms are identical and cancel, similar to Case 1 above.\nCase 3 Now, for most choices of (τ, δ) the constants (α Z(aδ) + α aτ ) and (α Z(aδ) + α aτ ) will both be nonzero, and in that case we get a distribution whose correlation values are the same as the regular Gold cross correlation values, but the number of occurences of each value along a row/column varies considerably, according to the sampling that happens from different gold functions based on the exact value of (τ, δ, k) that must be considered. We refer to rows and columns since we can visualize the Θ(τ, δ) distribution as a 2 dimensional array indexed by (τ, δ) ∈ [0, 2 n − 2] × [0, 2 n − 2].\nCase 4 When exactly one of the two equations below hold modulo 2 n − 1:\nwe again get a sampling from Gold cross correlation values along a row/column.\nIn last year\u2019s paper [2] we noted that in general when one of the equations in (2) holds, the other one does not, since the pseudorandom permutation induced on Z ∗ 2 n −1 by Z(·) is unlikely to preserve points under multiplication by a. We can now state a necessary and sufﬁcient condition which rules out full peaks of Θ(τ, δ) = 2 n − 1 for δ and τ both nonzero, and makes the Gold sequences resilient with respect to LPI properties.\nTheorem 2. Let a = 2 e + 1, where gcd(2 e + 1, 2 n − 1) = 1. Then the two equations in (2) are simultaneously satisﬁed if and only if e|n.\nThe proof follows by observing that the following chain of equalities (modulo 2):\n⇔ α aδ = (α τ + 1) 2 e (α τ + 1) ⇔ α aδ = (α 2 e τ + 1) (α τ + 1)\nimplies that for both equations in (2) to hold we must have α 2 e τ +α τ = α τ (α (2 e −1)τ +1) = 0 which is impossible unless 2 e − 1 divides 2 n − 1. But this happens if and only if e divides n. And in that case, the values of τ = kT where k ≥ 1 is an integer and T = (2 n − 1)/(2 e − 1) will yield a peak of 2 n − 1 in Θ(τ, δ). Note that when this peak happens, one of the regular Gold correlation values will be \u201cmissing\u201d along the same row/column.\nThus in some sense the Gold sequences are more secure than the m-sequences from this point of view and are similar to Legendre sequences .\nWe have numerically considered the triple autocorrelation function of MSB sequences of Family A ﬁrst deﬁned in Boztas¸\nand Kumar [4], and the results indicate that the triple correla- tion is also Gold-like, i.e., like the distributions discussed in the subsection above, but less widely scattered in their row frequencies, than the Gold values. This is intriguing since the traditional correlations of this family is fully Gold-like as shown in [4]. It remains an open problem to obtain analytical results for the triple autocorrelations of this family.\nBent function sequences were introduced by Olsen et al [7]. They form a relatively small family\u2013the family size of 2 n/2 where we assume n is even, is roughly the square root of the period which is 2 n − 1. They asymptotically approach known lower bounds for sequence correlations, such as the Sidelnikov bound.\nThe design philosophy of bent function sequences was based on a frequency domain approach, and we shall consider them in that setting.\nDeﬁnition 3. Let n be even. Let a sequence r(t) be given as a mapping\nvia the identiﬁcation r(t) := r(α t ) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 n − 2 since F ∗ 2 n = {1, α, α 2 , . . . , α 2 n −2 } holds.\nFrom this it immediately follows that the correlation be- comes\nIt immediately follows that this transform has a lot of nice properties, including being self-inverse,\nNow, to consider triple autocorrelations, we focus only on nontrivial shifts (both τ and δ nonzero), and observe that we have, once we let y = α τ , z = α δ where neither y nor z are in the subﬁeld F 2 ,\nby repeated application of Parseval. This directly implies |Θ r (τ, δ)| ≤ 1 +\nwhere we deﬁne S r = {λ : ˆ r(λ) = 0}. Following along the lines of the derivation in [7] we note that since\nFrom here on, Olsen et al show that the classical correlation of Bent function sequences is at most 2 n/2 + 1 since they can choose a balanced r on F 2 d , to achieve |S r | = 2 n/2 . This they do by showing that for their choice of the balanced functions, and for all y not in F 2 it is possible to achieve the intersection upper bound below\nfor spectral support sets S r and S s corresponding to two distinct sequences s(t) and r(t) which are in the Bent function family.\nIn our case, we want to bound a triple intersection in size, but such an intersection is always a subset of a double intersection as bounded by Olsen et al. Moreover, we were only considering auto triple correlations, but it turns out we can also consider cross triple correlations and get the same result since all the spectral support sets in the bent function family obey the inequality above and hence have to obey the inequality\nwhich we require,for any 3 bent function sequences r(t), s(t) and p(t). Thus we have proved\nIn this paper, we have considered binary sequences with ideal autocorrelation and binary sequence families with op- timal correlation, and continued our investigation of their triple correlation functions. This forms an interesting area of further research, for example, we have no theoretical results on the GMW triple correlations, even though some experimental results were observed in [2]. Interestingly we have found that bent function sequences have well bounded auto- and cross- triple correlations.\nThis work was supported by an Australia-China Science Linkages Grant."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M.
