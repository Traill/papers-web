As a ﬁrst order approximation, the DoF of a channel characterizes its sum-capacity, normalized by logarithm of signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), in high SNR regime. Achievable DoFs for the 3-user SISO interference channel (IC) and 2×2 SISO X channel with output feedback have been reported in [3]. The DoF region of the two-user MIMO IC with both delayed CSIT and output feedback, known as Shannon feedback, has been studied in [9], [10].\nFeedback in multi-user channels with distributed transmit- ters naturally provides some level of transmitter cooperation. As such, there are connections between communication over these channels with feedback and that with full-duplex trans- mitter cooperation. However, it has been shown that under the full CSIT assumption, full-duplex cooperation and/or output feedback cannot increase DoF of the SISO interference and X channels [11]. Also, with no CSIT, full-duplex transmitter cooperation does not help to achieve more than one DoF, since the broadcast channel DoF is equal to one [12].\nIn this paper, we ﬁrst consider K-user SISO IC and M × K SISO X channel with delayed CSIT and full-duplex transmitter cooperation. We propose multi-phase transmission schemes that achieve DoFs greater than the best reported achievable DoFs for these channels with delayed CSIT but without transmitter cooperation [5]. Then, we investigate K-user IC and K × K X channel with output feedback and Shannon feedback and propose multi-phase transmission schemes that achieve DoF values strictly increasing in K.\nA K-user SISO AWGN interference channel is composed of K transmitters and K receivers, where transmitter i (TX i ), 1 ≤ i ≤ K, wishes to communicate a message to receiver i (RX i ). In time slot t, x [i] (t) ∈ C with E|x [i] (t)| 2 ≤ P is transmitted by TX i , and y [j] (t) ∈ C is received by RX j , where\nand z [j] (t) ∼ CN (0, 1) is the i.i.d. Gaussian noise. The CSI is deﬁned as the matrix H (t) \t h [ji] (t) 1≤i,j≤K with random elements which are i.i.d. across all nodes as well as time and have a ﬁnite-variance continuous distribution. Each receiver RX j knows { h [ji] (t)} K i =1 instantaneously but the other channel coefﬁcients with one time slot delay.\nAn M × K SISO AWGN X channel is a set of M transmitters and K receivers, where each transmitter has a message to communicate to each receiver. The input-output relationship of this channel is given by Eq. (1) with the summation ranging over the M transmitters.\nWe study three different feedback/transmitter cooperation models deﬁned as follows:\n\u2022 Full-duplex Delayed CSIT: The channel matrix H(t) be- comes available at all transmitters with one time slot delay via noiseless feedback (delayed CSIT). Moreover, the transmitters operate in full-duplex mode, i.e., they can transmit and receive simultaneously. Each transmitter has instantaneous access to its incoming full-duplex channel coefﬁcients.\n\u2022 Output Feedback: Channel output y [i] (t), 1 ≤ i ≤ K, is causally available at TX i via noiseless feedback.\n\u2022 Shannon Feedback: The transmitters have access to both delayed CSIT and output feedback.\nNote that in the output and Shannon feedback models deﬁned above, it has been implicitly assumed that the num- ber of transmitters is equal to the number of receivers. If R (P ) = (R 1 , R 2 , · · · , R N ) is an achievable rate tuple, then d lim P →∞ R (P )/ log 2 P is called an achievable DoF tuple and N n =1 d n is called an achievable DoF. The channel DoF region D is the closure of the set of all achievable DoF tuples d, and the channel DoF is max d∈D N n =1 d n .\nThese notations are widely used throughout this paper: S m ⊆ S K = {1, 2, · · · , K} denotes a subset of cardinality m of user indices. u [S m1 |S m2 ;S m3 ] represents a symbol which is available at each TX i , i ∈ S m 1 , and each RX j , j ∈ S m 3 , and is intended to be decoded at each RX j , j ∈ S m 2 . If S m 3 = {}, this symbol is denoted by u [S m1 |S m2 ] .\nThe main results of this paper are summarized in the fol- lowing six theorems. Theorems 1, 3 and 5 will be respectively proved in Sections IV to VI. The proofs of Theorems 2, 4 and 6 are referred to [13].\nTheorem 1: The K-user (K ≥ 3) SISO Gaussian IC with delayed CSIT and full-duplex transmitters can achieve DoF ICFD 1 (K) degrees of freedom almost surely, where\nDoF ICFD 1 (K) = \t 4 3 − 2 K\nTheorem 2: The M × K SISO Gaussian X channel with delayed CSIT and full-duplex transmitters can achieve DoF XFD 1 (M, K) degrees of freedom almost surely, where\nTheorem 3: The K-user (K ≥ 3) SISO Gaussian IC with output feedback can achieve DoF ICOF 1 (K) degrees of freedom almost surely, where\na(K)w(w − 1) 2 + w +1 2 , (4) with w ∗ K deﬁned as\nTheorem 4: The K × K SISO Gaussian X channel with output feedback can achieve DoF XOF 1 (K, K) = 2K K +1 degrees of freedom almost surely.\nTheorem 5: The K-user (K ≥ 3) SISO Gaussian IC with Shannon feedback can achieve DoF ICSF 1 (K) degrees of free- dom almost surely, where\n  \n     \n    \n(9) Theorem 6: The K × K SISO Gaussian X channel with\nShannon feedback can achieve DoF XSF 1 (K, K) degrees of freedom almost surely, where DoF XSF 1 (K, K) is given by\nLet us ﬁrst elaborate on our achievable scheme for the full- duplex 3-user IC with delayed CSIT and show that 6/5 DoF, suggested by Eq. (2), is achievable in this channel. Then, we propose our achievable scheme for the K-user case.\nConsider a 2-phase transmission scheme, wherein 6 infor- mation symbols are delivered to the receivers in 5 time slots:\n\u2022 Phase 1: During 3 time slots, 6 information symbols are fed to the channel as follows: In the ﬁrst time slot, TX 1 and TX 2 transmit u [1] 1 and u [2] 1 , respectively, while TX 3 is silent. RX 1 and RX 2 each receive one linear equation in terms of u [1] 1 and u [2] 1 . Therefore, if we deliver a linearly independent equation in terms of u [1] 1 and u [2] 1 to both RX 1\nand RX 2 , each of them will be able to decode both transmit- ted symbols. This equation is indeed the linear combination h [31] (1)u [1] 1 + h [32] (1)u [2] 1 received by RX 3 during this time slot. On the other hand, according to full-duplex operation of the transmitters, both TX 1 and TX 2 will have both u [1] 1 and u [2] 1\nby the end of the ﬁrst time slot. This along with the delayed CSIT assumption enables both TX 1 and TX 2 to reconstruct h [31] (1)u [1] 1 + h [32] (1)u [2] 1 . Thus, one can deﬁne\nrespectively (TX 2 is silent), and u [3,1|3,1;2] is generated. Therefore, it only remains to deliver u [1,2|1,2;3] , u [2,3|2,3;1] ,\n\u2022 Phase 2: During 2 time slots, TX 1 , TX 2 , and TX 3 repeat u [2,3|2,3;1] , u [3,1|3,1;2] , and u [1,2|1,2;3] , respectively. Each receiver obtains two random linear combinations of its two desired symbols, and thus, will decode its desired symbols.\nConsider the following (K −1)-phase transmission scheme: \u2022 Phase 1: For every subset S 3 = {i 1 , i 2 , i 3 } ⊆ S K , spend\n3 time slots to transmit 6 fresh information symbols {u [i 1 ] k , u [i 2 ] k , u [i 3 ] k } k =1,2 by {TX i 1 , TX i 2 , TX i 3 } and generate\nthe same way as phase 1 of the scheme for the 3-user IC. Therefore, 6 K 3 information symbols are transmitted in 3 K 3\ntime slots and 3 K 3 symbols of type u [S 2 |S 2 ;j] , j ∈ S K \\S 2 , are generated by the end of phase 1. We denote by DoF ICFD m (K), 2 ≤ m ≤ K − 1, our achievable DoF for transmission of symbols of type u [S m |S m ;j] , j ∈ S K \\S m , over the K-user IC with full-duplex delayed CSIT. The achieved DoF is then calculated as\nL m (n) lcm{n − m, m} \t (13) Q m (n) min{n − m, m}, \t (14)\nwhere lcm{x, y}, x, y ∈ Z, is the least common multiplier of x and y. This phase takes m +1 m α m (K) symbols u [S m |S m ;j] , j ∈ S K \\S m , transmits them over the channel in α m (K) Q m (K) time slots, and generates Q m (K)−1 Q\nα m (K) symbols of type u [S m +1 |S m +1 ;j] , j ∈ S K \\S m +1 , where α m (K) is deﬁned as\ntime slots, each TX i n , 1 ≤ n ≤ m + 1, transmits a random linear combina-\ni m +1 ) in each time slot. Therefore, a total of (m + 1) L m (K) m symbols are transmitted in L m (K) Q\n(K) time slots. Now, the fol- lowing observations are important:\nhas all the symbols { u [S m +1 \\{j}|S m +1 \\{j};j] k \t } L m (K)/m k =1 \t , by can- celing them, it will obtain L m (K) Q\nequations out of its received equations, solely in terms of its desired symbols.\n(b) TX i , i ∈ S m +1 , has all the transmitted symbols except for { u [S m +1 \\{i}|S m +1 \\{i};i] k \t } L m (K)/m k =1 \t . According to the full- duplex operation, it will obtain L m (K) Q\nrandom linear combi- nations of these symbols after canceling its known symbols, and since L m (K) Q\n≥ L m (K) m , it can decode all of them. (c) RX j , j ∈ S Q m (K)−1 , receives L m (K) Q\n(K) linear equations in terms of all transmitted symbols. If we deliver these linear combinations to RX j , j ∈ S m +1 , it will be able to cancel its undesired part as argued in observation (a) and obtain L m (K) Q\nequations solely in terms of its desired symbols. On the other hand, in view of observation (b) and according to the delayed CSIT assumption, TX i , i ∈ S m +1 , will have access to all these linear combinations by the end of the L m (K) Q\nlinear equations received by RX j , j ∈ S Q m (K)−1 , are denoted by { u [S m +1 |S m +1 ;j ] k \t } L m (K)/Q m (K) k =1 \t . After deliver- ing these (Q m (K)−1)× L m (K) Q\nsymbols to RX j , j ∈ S m +1 , it will be provided with a total of L m (K) linear combinations in terms of its L m (K) desired symbols. Also, it is easy to show that these linear combinations are linearly independent almost surely, and hence, can be solved for the desired symbols.\n(15) \u2022 Phase K − 1: During K − 1 time slots, each TX i ,\nceiver obtains K − 1 linear combinations of its K − 1 desired symbols and can decode all them. One then can write\nIt can be shown that Eq. (8) is a closed form solution to recursive Eq. (15) with initial condition (16). This together with Eq. (12) completes the proof.\nOur transmission scheme for the K-user IC with output feedback consists of K − µ(K) + 1 phases, where the integer µ(K), 2 ≤ µ(K) ≤ K/2 , will be determined later. We note\nthat for K = 3, our scheme reduces to a modiﬁed version of the scheme proposed in [3] and achieves the same 6/5 DoF.\n\u2022 Phase 1: For every subset S µ (K) ⊂ S K , and every subset S µ (K)−1 ⊆ S K \\S µ (K) , in one time slot, each TX i , i ∈ S µ (K) , transmits a fresh information symbol u [i] . Then, if we deliver µ(K) − 1 linearly independent combinations of the µ(K) transmitted symbols to RX i , i ∈ S µ (K) , it will be able to decode all the transmitted symbols. Thus, the equation received by RX j , j ∈ S µ (K)−1 , which will be available at TX j via the output feedback, is desired by all the receivers RX i , i ∈ S µ (K) . Hence, they can be denoted as u [j|S µ (K) ;j] ,\nTherefore, µ(K) K µ (K) K−µ (K) µ (K)−1 information symbols are transmitted in \t K µ (K) K−µ (K) µ (K)−1 time slots and (µ(K) −\nend of phase 1. Denoting by DoF ICOF m (K) our achievable DoF for transmission of symbols u [j|S m ;j] , j ∈ S K \\S m , over the K-user IC with output feedback, the achieved DoF is equal to\n\u2022 Phase m, 2 ≤ m ≤ K − 2: This phase feeds m +1 m α m (K) symbols of type u [j|S m ;j] , j ∈ S K \\S m , to the channel in\nα m (K) symbols of type u [j|S m +1 ;j] , j ∈ S K \\S m +1 . In speciﬁc, for every sub- set S m +1 ⊂ S K , and every subset S Q m (K)−1 ⊆ S K \\S m +1 ,\nrandom linear combinations of symbols {u [i|S m +1 \\{i};i] k \t } L m (K)/m k =1 \t . Each RX j , j ∈ S m +1 , wishes to decode the L m (K) symbols {u [j |S m +1 \\{j };j ] k \t } L m (K)/m k =1 \t , j ∈ S m +1 \\{j}. Also, RX j , j ∈ S m +1 , after removing {u [j|S m +1 \\{j};j] k \t } L m (K)/m k =1 \t from its received equations, obtains\nlinear equations solely in terms of its desired sym- bols. If we deliver the L m (K) Q\nlinear equations received by RX j , j ∈ S Q m (K)−1 , to RX j , j ∈ S m +1 , it will obtain another (Q m (K) − 1) × L m (K) Q\nlinear equations solely in terms of its desired symbols. Since these equations will be available at TX j , j ∈ S Q m (K)−1 , via the output feedback, they are denoted as { u [j |S m +1 ;j ] k \t } L m (K)/Q m (K) k =1 \t . Therefore, RX j , j ∈ S m +1 , will have L m (K) (linearly independent) equations in terms of its L m (K) desired symbols, and can solve them for its desired symbols.\n\u2022 Phase K − 1: During K − 1 time slots, TX i , i ∈ S K , re- peats the symbol u [i|S K \\{i};i] . Therefore, each receiver obtains K − 1 linear combinations of its K − 1 desired symbols, and can decode all its desired symbols. Hence, DoF ICOF K− 1 = K K− 1 .\nIt is easy to see that the achieved DoF, i.e., DoF ICOF m (K), satisﬁes Eq. (15), and thus, is given in closed form by Eq. (8). Equation (4) then follows from maximizing DoF ICOF 1 (K) over µ(K). The maximization details can be found in [13].\nOur achievable scheme for the K-user IC with Shannon feedback has two rounds of operation as follows:\nRound 1: In this round, the transmitters use only the output feedback in parallel with the scheme proposed in Section V. In speciﬁc, during phase 1, for every subset S ν (K) ⊂ S K , every subset S ν (K)−1 ⊆ S K \\S ν (K) , and every j 0 ∈ S ν (K)−1 , in one time slot, each TX i , i ∈ S ν (K) , transmits a fresh information symbol u [i] . The integer ν(K), 2 ≤ ν(K) ≤ K/2 , will be determined later. The linear combination received by RX j , j ∈ S ν (K)−1 , which will be available at TX j via the output feedback, is desired by every RX i , i ∈ S ν (K) .\nNow, TX i , i ∈ S ν (K) , using Shannon feedback and hav- ing u [i] , obtains an equation in terms of the symbols u [i ] , i ∈ S ν (K) \\{i}. We deliver the ν(K) − 2 linear combinations available at the receivers RX j , j ∈ S ν (K)−1 \\{j 0 }, to RX i , i ∈ S ν (K) , using the scheme proposed in Section V. Meanwhile, TX i using Shannon feedback and having u [i] , will obtain another ν(K) − 2 linearly independent combinations of u [i ] , i ∈ S ν (K) \\{i}, and hence, can decode all of them. Thereby, it can reconstruct the linear combination available at RX j 0 , which is still required by every RX i , i ∈ S ν (K) . Hence, this linear combination will be denoted as u [S ν (K) ∪{j 0 }|S ν (K) ;j 0 ] .\nWe note that, for every subset S ν (K)+1 ⊆ S K , and every subset S ν (K)−2 ⊆ S K \\S ν (K)+1 , we have generated ν(K) + 1 symbols u [S ν (K)+1 |S ν (K)+1 \\{j 0 };j 0 ] , j 0 ∈ S ν (K)+1 . Since every RX i , i ∈ S ν (K)+1 , needs exactly ν(K) out of these ν(K) + 1 symbols, ν(K) random linear combinations of these symbols are desired by each RX i , i ∈ S ν (K)+1 , and can be denoted as { u [S ν (K)+1 |S ν (K)+1 ] k \t } ν (K) k =1 . They will be delivered during the round 2. The achieved DoF is therefore given by\ndenotes our achievable DoF for transmission of the symbols of type u [S m |S m ] over the K-user IC with Shannon feedback.\nRound 2: This round consists of K − ν(K) phases described as follows:\n\u2022 Phase m, ν(K) + 1 ≤ m ≤ K − 1: In this phase, sym- bols of type u [S m |S m ] are fed to the channel and symbols of type u [S m +1 |S m +1 ] are generated as follows: Fix a subset S Q m (K+1)+m−1 ⊆ S K , where Q m (n), n ∈ Z, is deﬁned in Eq. (14). For any S m ⊂ S Q m (K+1)+m−1 , spend one time slot to transmit { u [S m |S m ] k \t } Q m (K+1) k =1 \t by Q m (K + 1) arbitrary transmitters out of {TX j : j ∈ S m }. Then, RX j , j ∈ S m , requires Q m (K + 1) − 1 extra equations to resolve all the transmitted symbols. Thus, the linear combination received by RX j , j ∈ S Q m (K+1)+m−1 \\S m , which will be available\nat TX j via the output feedback, is desired by every RX j , j ∈ S m . Also, every TX j , j ∈ S m , having access to all the transmitted symbols and delayed CSI, can reconstruct this lin- ear combination. Therefore, it is denoted as u [S m ∪{j }|S m ;j ] .\nNow, for any subset S m +1 ⊆ S Q m (K+1)+m−1 , consider m + 1 symbols u [S m +1 |S m +1 \\{j};j] , j ∈ S m +1 . It is easy to see that m random linear combinations of these symbols are desired by each RX i , i ∈ S m +1 , and can be denoted as {u [S m +1 |S m +1 ] k \t } m k =1 . The achieved DoF equals\n\u2022 Phase K: In this phase, one symbol u [S K |S K ] per time slot is transmitted by an arbitrary transmitter. Hence,\nIt can be shown that the closed form solution to the recursive Eq. (19) with initial condition (20) is given by Eq. (9). Therefore, the proof is complete in view of Eq. (18) and the fact that ν(K) is chosen to maximize DoF ICSF 1 (K).\nFigures 1 and 2 plot our achievable DoFs for the K-user IC and K × K X channel with full-duplex delayed CSIT, output and Shannon feedbacks, and compare them with the best reported achievable DoFs for the same channels with delayed CSIT [5] for 2 ≤ K ≤ 30. It is seen that our achievable DoFs are strictly increasing in K and greater than those with delayed CSIT. Also, as K → ∞, we have DoF ICFD 1 (K) →\n, DoF ICOF 1 (K) → DoF ICSF 1 (K) → DoF XOF 1 (K, K) → DoF XSF 1 (K, K) → 2, and also DoF XFD 1 (M, K) → 6 π 2 −6 if\nThe fast fading SISO IC and X channel were investigated without instantaneous CSIT. Transmission schemes were pro- posed under three different assumptions, namely, full-duplex delayed CSIT , output feedback, and Shannon feedback, which achieve strictly increasing DoFs with number of receivers. The DoF characterization of both channels under each considered assumption remains open in the lack of tight upper bounds."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"M. A. Maddah-Ali"},{"name":"D.
