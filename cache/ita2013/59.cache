Let B n r (x) be the ball (solid sphere) centered at some point x = (x 1 , . . . , x n ) of an n-dimensional Euclidean space R n :\nWe also use a simpler notation B n r if a ball is centered at the origin x = 0. For any subset A ⊂ R n , we say that a subset Cov(A, ε) ⊆ R n forms an ε-covering (an ε-net) of A if A is contained in the union of the balls of radius ε centered at points x ∈ Cov(A, ε) :\nBy changing the scale in R n , we can always consider the rescaled set A/ε and the new covering Cov(A/ε, 1) with unit balls B n 1 (x). Without loss of generality, below we consider these (unit) coverings. One of the classical problems is to obtain tight bounds on the covering size |Cov(B n r , 1)| for any ball B n r of radius r and dimension n.\nThen the unit balls B n+1 1 (x) cover this sphere with spherical caps\nIn this notation, a cap C n r (ρ, y) has some center y ∈ S n r , half- chord ρ ≤ 1, and the corresponding half-angle α = arcsin ρ/r. The maximum half-chord ρ = 1 is obtained if the center x of the ball B n+1 1 (x) has Euclidean weight\nTo obtain a minimal covering, we shall consider spherical caps C n r (1, y) assuming that all the balls B n+1 1 (x) satisfy (1). Throughout the paper, all caps will be considered in\nS n r ; therefore we use a shorter notation C(ρ, y) instead of C n r (ρ, y). Notation C(ρ) will also be used when a speciﬁc center y is of no importance.\nSpherical coverings often arise in multidimensional (vec- tor) quantizers [5]. In particular, consider n-dimensional data points z ∈ R n+1 that have the same energy r 2 and are uniformly distributed in the sphere S n r . A typical quantizer provides a covering {x} of the sphere S n r which limits the mean (squared) rounding error (x − z) 2 . Zador\u2019s theorem [5] shows that this error can be reduced per dimension by using quantization in higher dimensions n. In this case, given the maximum rounding error ε caused by a quantizer, we wish to ﬁnd the thinnest ε-covering Cov(S n r ) of the sphere S n r .\nPreliminaries. Given a set A of volume |A| , the two important quantities are the minimal covering size |Cov(A, 1)| and the covering density\nMinimal coverings have been long studied for both the sphere S n r and the ball B n r . In particular, we mention the following results. The Coxeter-Few-Rogers \u201csimplex\u201d bound shows that for any sphere S n r of radius r ≥ 1 + 1 n 1/2 ,\nHere and below c i denote some universal constants. Various upper bounds on the minimum covering density are obtained for B n r and S n r in the renowned papers [1] and [2]. In particular, a sufﬁciently large ball B n r can be covered with the density\nFor smaller radii r, recent advances are obtained in [3] and [4]. In particular, it is proven in [3] (see Corollary 1.2 and Remark 5.1) that for any radius r,\nTheorem 1: For any β > 1 2 , a sphere S n r of any radius r and growing dimension n → ∞ can be covered with spherical caps C(1, y) of half-chord 1 with density\nNotation. Below we consider a sphere S n r for growing dimension n → ∞ and any given radius r > 1. Consider any cap C(ρ) of half-chord ρ ≤ 1 and half-angle α = arcsin ρ r . Let\ndenote the fraction of the surface of the sphere S n r covered by a cap C (ρ) . For any ρ < 1, we extensively use two inequalities (see [3]):\nGiven any d ∈ (0, r), we say that the two caps, C(ρ 1 , y) and C(ρ 2 , z) are d-close if (vectors) y and z have angle\nFinally, we use a shorter notation Cov(ρ) for any covering of the sphere S n r with spherical caps of half-chord ρ.\nTo design a covering Cov(1), we shall also use another covering\nwith smaller caps C(ε, u). In general, Cov(ε) with density δ has size\nHere we allow to employ any redundant covering, whose density δ can be much greater than n ln n. Then we try to directly cover all the centers u ∈ Cov (ε) by the randomly chosen caps C(ρ, y). We use positive parameter γ and stop after performing\ntrials (here we assume that N is an integer). We consider all uncovered centers u ∈ Cov (ε) and form the extended set\nObviously, this set forms a covering Cov (1) of the sphere S n r with the bigger caps C(1, y).\nThen the sphere S n r has a covering Cov (1) of size ¯ Y ≤ n ln n\nvalid for any ε ∈ (0, 1). Also, according to (6), Ω 1 /Ω ε ≤ ε −n .\nNow we use (10) to ﬁnd the expected number E |{u }| of uncovered centers\nwhere we used a substitution from (11) in the last inequality. Then we estimate N. From (6) and (7), we deduce that\nHere the second inequality can be numerically veriﬁed for any 3 ≤ n ≤ 7, while for n ≥ 8 it follows from (14). Therefore\nThen our covering ¯ Y of size N +E |{u }| gives estimates (12) and (13).\nDiscussion. Assume that we use a covering Cov (ε) of polynomial density δ = n c . Then it is readily veriﬁed that for large n, bound (11) gives an estimate\nwhich is similar to the estimate of [3] and the above bound (2). Note, however, that (16) is valid even if we use an exponential density δ = e cn in (9). Indeed, in this case we obtain Cov(1) with density of order δ = (c + 1)n ln n for any sphere S n R . Due to the scaling property of R n+1 , this Cov(1) also gives the same density δ for the rescaled covering Cov(ε) on the sphere S n Rε . Thus, we can take r = Rε and begin designing Cov(1) using the new covering Cov(ε) of density δ . In turn, this again gives estimate (16).\nNote, however, that this approach is inefﬁcient for any γ < 1. First, using a better covering Cov(ε) (even with density less than n ln n) still results in the same density order of n ln n in (13), after this method is applied. Nor can we increase parameter ε. In particular, let ε = n −β , where β ∈ (0, 1). Then the ratio Ω 1 /Ω ρ has an exponential order of e (1−β)n in (15), which in turn yields an exponential density in (13), even in spite of a reduced size |Cov(ε)| .\nTherefore, in the next section we modify our approach. We indeed use the larger radius n −β and design the covering Cov(n −β ). However, it will only work due to the fact that a typical cap C(n −β , z) intersects multiple caps C(ρ, y). Also, even these multiple intersections will be allowed to leave some small holes in the caps C(n −β , z). This approach is described below.\nLet β ∈ ( 1 2 , 1) and γ ∈ (β, 1). We consider the same parameters ε and ρ as deﬁned in (7). Let\nBelow we obtain a covering Cov(1) of the sphere S n r with density βn ln n using three steps. In the ﬁrst - preliminary - step, we assume that the same sphere S n r is covered by two different coverings Cov(µ) and Cov(ε). In the second step, we try to cover the caps C(µ, z) ∈ Cov(µ) with the bigger caps C(ρ, y). The trials occur so many times that typical caps C(µ, z) are left with the holes of radius ε or less. All other (atypical) caps C(µ, z) are then added to the former set {C(ρ, y)} . Finally, we expand the caps C(ρ, y) to the full size C(1, y) and cover the entire sphere. More precisely, we perform the following.\n1. Consider two coverings of the sphere S n r : Cov(µ) : S n r ⊆\nWe assume that both coverings have density δ ≤ n 2 . Then Cov(ε) has size (9) and\npoints y ∈ S n r . Consider N spherical caps C(ρ, y). Then we examine the centers u of the covering Cov (ε) as follows.\nLet C(µ, ˇ z) be any cap of the covering Cov (µ) that contains at least one center u ∈ Cov (ε) yet uncovered by the bigger caps C(ρ, y). We consider the entire set {ˇ z} of such centers.\nNote that any point on the sphere S n r falls within distance ε from the union of the caps C(ρ, y) with centers y ∈ ¯ Y . Therefore, the extended caps C(1, y) form a covering\n¯ Y ≤ Ω −1 d · γn ln n (1 + o(1)) . \t (20) We begin with the following important lemma.\nLemma 4: Consider two d-close caps, C(µ, Z) and C(ρ, Y) on a sphere S n r ,\nwhere d is deﬁned in (17). Then the bigger cap C(ρ, Y) covers the smaller cap C(µ, Z), with an exception of its fraction\nSketch of the proof. In Fig. 1, we represent the two caps C(µ, Z) and C(ρ, Y), with centers Z and Y. These two caps have bases P QRS and P M RT, which form the balls B n µ (A) and B n ρ (B). The bigger cap C(ρ, Y) covers the base B n µ (A) of the smaller cap, with an exception of the part P QR. Note that the boundary of the base B n µ (A) is the sphere S n−1 µ (A). In turn, the boundary of the uncovered base P QR forms a cap on S n−1 µ (A) with center Q and half-angle α = P AQ. We ﬁrst estimate this half-angle α.\nLet d(H, G) denote the distance between any two points H and G. Also, let σ(H) be the distance from a point H to the line OBY that connects the origin O of the sphere S n r to the base center B and then to the cap center Y. Then\nwhere we use (21) for the second inequality. On the other hand,\nFinally, note that by deﬁnition of the center B, d(B, N) = σ(N) and\nTherefore, we consider the right triangle ANP and deduce that\nNow we can calculate the fraction Ω that the cap P QR occupies on the sphere S n−1 µ (A). This fraction Ω is deﬁned in (5) by its angle α, which gives\nFinally, it can be easily proven that the uncovered fraction θ of the entire cap C(µ, Z) is upper-bounded by the uncovered fraction Ω of its base.\nRemark. The choice of d in (21) is critical for Lemma 4. In fact, about half the cap C(µ, Z) becomes uncovered if the two caps used in Lemma 4 are (d + ε)-close. If this distance is further increased to ρ, then C(µ, Z) becomes almost uncovered.\nOur next goal is to prove that most centers z have sufﬁ- ciently many d-close caps C(ρ, y) after N trials. Namely, let N caps C(ρ, y) be randomly chosen. We separate all spherical caps C(µ, z) into two subsets as follows. We say that a cap C(µ, z) is bad and denote it C (µ, z) if it has only\nor less d-close caps C(ρ, y). Let {C (µ, z)} be the subset of all bad caps, whereas {C (µ, z)} includes the remaining (good) caps. We ﬁrst prove that the mean number N of bad caps is negligible even to the number of random trials N.\nLemma 5: For n → ∞, any cap C(µ, z) is bad with a probability\nProof. Given any center z, a randomly chosen cap C(ρ, y) is d-close to z with the probability p = Ω d . Thus, for N of (18), the expected number of d-close caps C(ρ, y) is\nThen for n → ∞, the probability P that l = o(n) or less caps are d-close is\nIn our last equality, we again use the fact that l = n 3/2−β is sublinear in n ( in fact, the above function o(1) has the order of n 1/2−β ). Thus, given the covering size |Cov(µ)| = δ/Ω µ , we calculate the expected number of bad caps,\nd µ\nwhich is an exponentially small fraction o (N ) of N for any γ > β.\nThe second important fact is that most remaining caps C (µ, z) are covered almost entirely. Namely, let N be the total number of centers u ∈ Cov (ε) left uncovered in all the caps C (µ, z).\nLemma 6: For n → ∞, the number of uncovered centers u ∈ Cov (ε) has expectation\nProof. There exist at most |Cov(ε)| centers u within all caps C (µ, z). Any cap C (µ, z) is covered at least l times. Each time, a random fraction θ of its surface is left uncovered. Therefore any point u ∈ C (µ, z) is left uncovered with probability θ l , according to Lemma 4. Thus,\nHere in the last inequality we use the fact that n ln n = o(n β+ 1/2 ) for any β > 1/2 and sufﬁciently large n, which gives a vanishing fraction (4).\nProof of Claim 3 and Theorem 1. According to Lemmas 5 and 6, there exists a set of N caps C(ρ, y) that leaves only N = o (N ) bad caps C (µ, z ) and N = o (N ) uncovered centers u ∈ Cov (ε). Let C (µ, z ) be any cap within the set C with an uncovered center u . Now we take the set of additional centers\nand surround all of them with the caps C(ρ, ˇ z). The total number of these new caps is o(N ), which gives Claim 3.\nhas size ¯ N = N +o(N ). By extending all these caps to radius 1, we obtain a 1-covering of density\nFinally, we prove that Ω d ∼ Ω 1 for sufﬁciently large n. Similarly to the proof of Lemma 2, we see that for n → ∞\nSince both parameters β and γ can be chosen arbitrarily close to 1/2, this proves (4) and completes the proof of Theorem 1.\nRemark. The latter two lemmas also explain our choice of parameter l. First, for any γ > β, it gives only an exponentially small fraction o (N ) of bad caps in Lemma 5. On the other hand, it gives a vanishing fraction o (N ) of uncovered centers in (24) for any β > 1/2.\nThe following Theorem 7 can be proven in a similar way, by combining the technique of Theorem 1 with multilayered design described in [2] and [4].\nTheorem 7: For any β > 1 2 , a ball B n r of growing radius r → ∞ and dimension n → ∞ can be covered with unit balls B n 1 (x) with density\nCorollary 8: Euclidean spaces R n of growing dimension n → ∞ can be covered with unit balls B n 1 (x) with density"},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"A.
