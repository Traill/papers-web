While regenerating codes minimize data download for node repair, codes with locality minimize the number of nodes accessed during repair.  In this paper, we provide constructions of codes with locality, in which the local codes are regenerating codes, thereby combining the advantages of both classes of codes. We also derive upper bounds on the minimum distance and code size for this class of codes and show that the proposed constructions achieve this bound. The constructions include both the cases when the local regenerating codes correspond to the MSR point as well as the MBR point on the storage repair-bandwidth tradeoff curve (joint with G. M.

In nature, sound perceived by humans consists of small pressure waves in the range of 20Hz-20KHz, propagat- ing in the air. Earthquakes/tsunamis occur as large pressure waves propagating in the earth\u2019s crust/oceans. Waves are also generated by humans: electromagnetic wave ﬁelds are created for purposes such as communication and object tracking, and acoustic waves are used for example to build images of internal human organs, or to locate oil. Thus, it is not hard to argue that there is great interest in understanding how to perform signal processing tasks on spatial waves. Of particular interest in this work is the task of compressing these waves.\nSpatial waves form a fundamentally different class of ob- jects from those traditionally studied in signal processing theory. Classical DSP is built on the assumption that signals are bandlimited functions of their arguments, meaning that their Fourier transform is compactly supported. Spatial waves are not bandlimited functions of their arguments \u2013 the proper abstraction for waves is to regard them as solutions of a partial differential equation. And this shift in point of view (from signals being bandlimited functions to signals being solutions of the wave equation), when it comes to the data compression problem for waves, brings out some new challenges, which we begin to address in this work, whose long term goal is to determine the rate-distortion characteristics of waves.\nWhat is a wave ﬁeld? Perhaps the simplest explanation can be given in terms of the spring-mass model for an oscillator [11, Ch. 1], as illustrated in Fig. 1 .\nIn the simple physical system of Fig. 1 , when energy is supplied in the form of displacing the elemental mass from its rest position, the spring produces another force which attempts\nto bring the mass back to rest. This force sets the mass in motion, and results in a certain pressure on the mass. Clearly, the motion will be an oscillation in the horizontal direction: the spring pulls the mass back, then pushes it away, then pulls it back again, and so on, until all the energy supplied by the initial displacement is dissipated (or forever, if there is no dissipation at all).\nThe next step is to extend this model to a one-dimensional vibration. And for this purpose, consider a chain of masses all interconnected by springs, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . A numerical solution to the 1D wave equation, for a simple excitation applied at the center of the membrane, is illustrated in Fig. 3 .\nWith this example in one dimension clear, it is not difﬁcult to extend this concept to multiple dimensions, and allowing for inhomogeneities (springs with different characteristics in terms of stiffness), and boundary conditions. In this work, we will limit our attention to the simple homogeneous 1D case.\nIn this paper we study the problem of efﬁciently encoding waves. First, in Section II we develop a simple mathematical abstraction for waves, as well as the tools for their analysis. Then, in Section III we formulate the problem of coding waves. In developing a solution to the coding problem, we identify a basic sampling problem, for which a number of results from our work in progress are reviewed in Section IV . A survey of some related work is presented in Section V . The paper concludes with Section VI .\nSensing and actuation problems on waves do not ﬁt into the classical signal processing paradigm of modeling signals as bandlimited processes.\nThe sinc basis functions used to represent a signal in terms of its samples, and the basis of complex exponentials used in the Fourier transform, provide a powerful set of tools for processing bandlimited signals using linear and time-invariant operators:\n\u2022 Using the sinc basis, a bandlimited signal can be repre- sented in terms of a set of its samples. Thus, any operation we may wish to apply to the continuous-time signal can be expressed in terms of operations on these samples.\n\u2022 Using the basis of complex exponentials, the design and analysis of linear and time-invariant operators is greatly simpliﬁed, since the former are eigenfunctions of the latter.\nThese two observations provide the foundation for digital signal processing: a linear and time-invariant operator acting on a bandlimited signal can be implemented as an A/D coverter, a digital ﬁlter, and a D/A converter [16].\nWhereas this is a richly developed theory with countless applications in real life, waves are simply not well modeled as bandlimited signals, and the type of operations we may want to apply on them are just not well modeled by linear and time- invariant operators. In this section we will see however that a different basis, chosen to diagonalize a different operator, plays an equally fundamental role for waves.\nConsider a 1D membrane of length π, consisting of a large number of elemental masses connected by springs, as depicted in Fig. 2 . Acting on this membrane is a source that at time t, at location x, applies a force s (x, t). The source s generates waves in the membrane, inducing a pressure ﬁeld p. And from elementary newtonian mechanics relating mass, pressure, force, position, velocity and acceleration, we can obtain a differential equation that constrains the values that p and s can take simultaneously: for all x ∈ [0, π], for all t ∈ R, we must have that\nSee, for example, the textbook of Berkhout [5] for a thorough treatment on this subject.\nFor a given source s and ﬁxed boundary conditions, it is not difﬁcult to prove that the wave equation admits a unique solution for p. Thus, our ﬁrst goal is to express that unique solution p in terms of s. To do that, we proceed as follows [9, Ch. 2]:\n1) First we consider the problem in the Fourier domain: regarding the spatial coordinates as constants, we take a Fourier transform of both p (x, t) and s(x, t) with respect to their time variable t. The resulting spectra are denoted by ˆ p (x, ω) and ˆ s (x, ω).\n2) We expand both the source ˆ s (x, ω), and the sought solu- tion ˆ p (x, ω), into sine and cosine spatial eigenfunctions of the differential equation [6].\n3) We plug both the source function and the solution that we seek into the forced differential equation, and we collect the coefﬁcients associated with each eigenfunc- tion [7].\n4) We pick a set of boundary conditions, in our case indicating that the boundaries are perfectly reﬂecting. This is captured by requiring that for all t, ∂p ∂x | x =0 =\nFollowing these steps, it is not difﬁcult to prove that the solution can be expressed as\nand where c is the speed at which waves propagate in the membrane, a \t ω c is a new frequency variable (normalized by the speed of propagation c), and ˆ s is the spectrum of the source [21].\nC. A Linear System Interpretation for Wave Fields in Mem- branes with Point Sources.\n1) Point Sources in Membranes of Finite Length: The solu- tion to the wave equation shown above makes no assumptions whatsoever about the shape of the source: this source was assumed to be a general function acting anywhere on the membrane. We do have a special interest though in wave ﬁelds that arise from considering point sources, i.e., sources that occupy a contiguous region of space that is very small compared to the size of the membrane. An arbitrary point source at location x 0 , in the frequency domain, has the form\nwhere ˆ s is the temporal spectrum of a temporal source. Our interest in point sources is motivated by the fact that most ﬁelds arising in the applications that motivate us to study this problem can be modeled quite accurately as being generated by a ﬁnite number of point sources.\n2) The Frequency Response of a Finite Membrane: To obtain a simpler expression for p, we need to evaluate the coefﬁcients p n (a), now taking into account the structure of this source. By a simple substitution in the solution for p, we get that\nthis expression provides much insight into the structure of wave ﬁelds generated by point sources:\n\u2022 The pressure signal observed at an arbitrary location x can be expressed as the convolution of the source signal s (t) with a linear ﬁlter h(x, t). For obvious reasons, we refer to this function as the impulse response of the membrane, and to its Fourier transform as the frequency response.\n\u2022 The ﬁlter h (x, t) depends on a number of parameters: \u2013 The location x of the ﬁeld measurement. \u2013 The location x 0 of the source signal.\n\u2013 The dimension of the membrane (π here, chosen for convenience).\nˆ h (x, a) has an asymptote at all integer frequencies a ∈ Z. These special frequencies are referred to as the modes of the membrane [11].\nEquipped with this toolbox, we formulate next the problem of encoding solutions to the wave equation driven by a spatial source of information s (x, t).\nIn this section, we formulate the problem of coding waves. To do so, we deﬁne a class of codes intended to capture what we deem to be the essence of a fundamental problem of data compression in sensor networks. We ask whether it is possible to ﬁnd N locations such that, if we observe a spatial data ﬁeld (waves, in this case) at each one of them, and deliver an encoding of these observations to a central decoder, then that central encoder can produce an estimate of the entire ﬁeld within a given distortion D. Formal deﬁnitions follow.\nLet (X t ) t∈R denote a continuous-time, stationary random process, and let X denote the set of all such processes. Let (P x,t ) 0≤x≤π,t∈R denote the unique solution of the wave equation, when forced using X at some ﬁxed and known location x 0 ∈ [0, π], and let P denote the set of all such solutions. For a ﬁxed location ξ ∈ [0, π], P (ξ, t) t∈R denotes the wave measured at ξ, and the set of all such measurements is denoted by P(ξ).\nFor two solutions P, Q ∈ P, at time t and location x, deﬁne d x,t (P, Q) = E (P x,t − Q x,t ) 2 . Based on this, deﬁne a distortion measure between P and Q as\nFor a ﬁxed block length n, and ﬁxed locations 0 ≤ ξ 1 < ... < ξ N ≤ π, the encoders are N functions\n\u2022 a set of N measurement locations ξ 1 ...ξ N , for some ﬁnite value of N ;\n\u2022 encoding functions f k , k = 1...N ; \u2022 a decoding function g;\n\u2022 First, we need to make sure that the object R N (D) is well deﬁned. For that purpose, we need to verify that there exists a value of N that is independent of D, for all possible distortion levels. 1\n\u2022 Second, but more fundamentally, we need to give a complete and computable characterization of the object R(D), in terms of information theoretic quantities.\nPerhaps the simplest way to highlight the challenges in- volved in coding waves is to draw a parallel with other similar compression tasks that are better understood: source coding of continuous-time bandlimited processes. So consider a stationary Gaussian process X t , with mean zero and a bandlimited autocorrelation function R X (τ ), of bandwidth Ω. It is well known that the discrete-time process X nT , with T < 1 2Ω , can be interpolated to recover the original process X t in the mean-squared sense [17], [22]. Then, the discrete-time process can be compressed using standard techniques [4].\nWe see in the example above that a key step in solving the source coding problem for continuous-time bandlimited processes is the sampling step. This form of discretization has its roots in Shannon\u2019s sampling theorem, which states that any signal with ﬁnite squared integral and Fourier transform supported over [−π, π] can be expressed as\nFor waves however, there are two reasons that make ﬁnding one such discrete representation a somewhat more difﬁcult matter:\n\u2022 Waves, deﬁned over a ﬁnite membrane, cannot be ban- dlimited functions of space. So in the classical sense, there is a severe aliasing effect to deal with.\n\u2022 Practical considerations, stemming from difﬁculties in physically realizing devices capable of observing the entire signal ﬁeld in space (and already embedded in our codes deﬁned in Section III ), preclude the use of bandlimiting operators such as an analog anti-aliasing preﬁlter.\nOur ﬁrst result towards the computation of R(D) is that a representation such as that of eqn. ( 2 ) for bandlimited signals is indeed possible for waves.\n1) Temporal Sampling: Assume the source ˆ s (a) itself is a bandlimited function in time, of normalized bandwidth a 0 . Thus, for any ﬁxed location 0 ≤ x ≤ π, the support of ˆ p (x, a) is also a conﬁned to a range of size at most a 0 . Therefore, it follows from classical arguments that the set of samples {p(x, mT )} m∈Z uniquely speciﬁes the continuous time function p (x, t), provided T < 1 2a\n. If the source itself is not bandlimited, then the temporal sampling problem can be dealt with using standard techniques for dealing with such cases [23], [24], [25].\n2) Spatial Sampling: From the deﬁnition of the impulse response of the membrane earlier, it is easy to see that in general, the pressure signal at arbitrary locations x and x \u2032 are related by\nThis is immediate, since ˆ p (x,a) ˆ h (x,a) = ˆ s (a). This relationship needs some qualiﬁers though, since two conditions may occur to render it invalid:\n(1) If for some mode m ∈ Z, ˆs(m) = 0, then ˆ p (x, m) is not deﬁned.\n(2) If at some location x there is a frequency a for which ˆ h (x, a) = 0, then a \u201ccannot be heard\u201d at x, and so any information in a will be missing from the measurements collected at x.\nThe relationship in eqn. ( 3 ) allows us to highlight what exactly are the challenges involved in the spatial sampling problem. To sample in space, essentially what we have to do is \u201cdeal\u201d with zeros in the impulse response ˆ h (x, a). And our\nway of dealing with those zeros is as follows: we write, for all 0 ≤ x ≤ π and a ∈ R,\nSuch an identity essentially says that we can express ˆ p as a linear combination of some interpolating functions ˆ f k , and where the \u201ccoefﬁcients\u201d of this linear combination are given by samples of ˆ p taken at a ﬁnite set of locations ξ k (k = 1...n). Note that this relationship is given in the frequency domain: in time, what we are saying is that we want to be able to ﬁnd a linear ﬁlter to interpolate the time functions in space.\nTo ensure the existence of a representation such as that of eqn. ( 4 ), it is sufﬁcient to show that for a ﬁxed and ﬁnite set of locations {ξ 1 ...ξ N }, and for all a in the support of ˆ s, ˆ p (ξ k , a ) = 0, for at least one ξ k .\nAssume p (x, a) = s(a)h(x, a) is deﬁned on a compact set I such that I does not contain any integers n (n ≥ 0).\nTheorem 1: There exists N ≥ 1 and locations {ξ 1 ...ξ N }, such that for all a ∈ I, there is an ξ k for which h (ξ k , a ) = 0.\nWave propagation problems have been studied for a long time in physics and engineering, and they are reasonably well understood. Some textbooks we found particularly useful are [5], [10], [11]. The standard mathematical tool for dealing with these problems are differential equations with boundary value constraints, and Hilbert space methods for their solution. In this area, textbooks we relied on heavily are [6], [7], [9].\nOur approach to the sampling problem relies heavily on properties of analytic functions, and on the theory of uniform distribution of sequences. For this, we have found of particular help the textbooks of Ahlfors on complex analysis [1], and of Kuipers and Niederreiter on uniform distribution [13]. For elementary concepts on real variables we relied on [18].\nData modeling issues for problems originating in sensor networking applications (one of the motivations for this work), have been considered in [20], in [19], in [15], and in [3].\nIn the signal processing literature, questions involving spa- tial signal ﬁelds have been studied in the context of sound and light ﬁelds. A number of references on data compression for light ﬁelds are available from http://www.stanford.\nimpulse response h (x, t) has been referred to as the ple- nacoustic function [12]. Spatial sampling and reconstruction of this function has been considered in [2], and spectral properties of this function were studied in [8], under a far-ﬁeld assumption. A closely related signal processing problem is that of wave ﬁeld synthesis: in this case, the goal is to generate from a ﬁnite number of ﬁxed point sources a pre-speciﬁed wave ﬁeld [14]. Various groups, primarily in Germany and in the Netherlands, have studied this problem. A number of\nIn summary, most of the related work we are aware of has focused on applications and signal processing aspects of the problem under consideration, but little attention seems to have been paid to pure information theoretic questions.\nIn this paper, we have formulated a new multiterminal source coding problem. In our problem, the goal is to de- termine the least number of bits required to represent a wave ﬁeld in space, subject to a ﬁdelity criterion, and subject to the constraints encountered in sensor networking problems which prevent any one encoder from observing the entire signal ﬁeld. This is only the beginning of our work on this problem, and much remains to be done.\nFor Theorem 1 to be a complete solution to the sampling problem in space, we still need to provide an estimate of how large N needs to be made, in terms of known parameters in the problem \u2013 this would be a condition equivalent to the determination of the Nyquist rate for bandlimited signals. We do not have complete answers yet to this issue, but this is a topic currently under investigation, on which we hope to report more in the ﬁnal version of [21]. We have obtained one preliminary estimate, which we do not believe to be tight in any sense, but which we mention to illustrate the kind of characterization we are looking for. We have found that the solution of the forced equation p (x, a) can be reconstructed everywhere in a closed interval I ⊂ (n o , n o + 1) where a varies and n o ∈ Z, from at most N linear ﬁlters, provided N ≥ C o n o log(n o +1) ∆ 2 \t , and where ∆ is the minimum distance from I to one of the resonant integer frequencies n o or n o +1.\nOur goal for this paper was to introduce the problem, and to illustrate our ﬁrst steps towards its solution. The end goal though, as stated before, is to effectively compute the distributed rate-distortion function R(D) of eqn. ( 1 ).\nAcknowledgement\u2013The authors want to thank Georgios N.
