We show analytically that  the capacity loss of serving fewer users at low SNR is  much smaller than at high SNR.  The advantages of  serving fewer users are many: multi-user algorithms  often have better performance, lower complexity, and  reduced channel-knowledge requirements. We provide  guidelines on how many users to serve to get near-\ncapacity performance with low complexity.  For  example, we show that the performance gain in some  algorithms more than compensates for the loss in  capacity in an eight-antenna eight-user system when \nonly four users are served, and we are now  approximately 2dB from capacity at very low SNR.   "},"body":{"text":"Given a base-station or access-point with M transmit  antennas serving a pool of L  =  M autonomous single-\nantenna users who cannot cooperate with each other, we  wish to approach the sum-capacity, especially at low SNR.   This is a multi-antenna multi-user system, which is also  sometimes referred to as a Gaussian vector broadcast  channel.  The sum-capacity of such a system is investigated \nin [1-7], assuming that channel state information (CSI) is  available at the transmitter and receivers. \nAchieving capacity in this multi-antenna multi-user  channel ostensibly could in theory require us to serve all L =  M users simultaneously with the M transmit antennas. We  show that we may often serve fewer than M users with little  capacity penalty especially at low SNR.  We quantify the  penalty in this paper. \nWe focus on low SNR\u2019s or low SINR\u2019s (signal to  interference-plus-noise) because many multi-user systems \ncapacity at high SNR but suffer some performance loss at  low SNR. It is then important to improve the performance  of these algorithms at low SNR. One simple way to reduce  complexity and improve per-user performance is simply to  serve fewer users.  But serving fewer users is a viable  strategy only if we do not suffer a large total throughput  penalty in the process.   By computing the sensitivity of the  capacity to the number of users being served, we quantify  the loss and show that it is small at low SNR\u2019s. \nof users as follows: Given that we are serving a certain  number of users at a certain SNR, if we now serve fewer  users with the same number of antennas, how much do we \nneed to increase the SNR to obtain the same total  throughput?  The reduction in number of users is the  equivalent of a complexity reduction (that comes from less \nin the SNR is the equivalent of a power penalty. For  example, for eight transmit antennas, at  ρ  = 1dB (which is \ndefined as the ratio of total transmit power to per-user  receive noise power), we suffer a penalty of only 1.14dB in  SNR (increase in ρ) if we serve only four users, each at one-\nfourth the sum-capacity, versus all eight users, each at one- eighth this same sum-capacity. The corresponding penalty at \nρ = 10dB is more than 2.55dB, and the corresponding  penalty at  ρ = 20dB is more than 7.63dB.  We sometimes  call this power penalty a \u201closs\u201d. \nThus, to obtain capacity at low SNR\u2019s we may as well  serve fewer users at once, with algorithms that have low  complexity and good performance. Continuing the example  of the previous paragraph, we break the original pool of  eight users into two random groups of four and serve these  groups individually and suffer only a 1.14dB power penalty  at  ρ = 1dB.  In return, we obtain the benefit of requiring the \nCSI of only four users at the transmitter at one time.   Furthermore, we may obtain performance gains from any  algorithm used to serve the four users: for example, the  vector-perturbation technique gains approximately 1.5dB  gain over the same technique serving eight users (in the  eight-antenna system of this example).  We formulate the  problem in detail in the next section. \nConsider a multi-antenna multi-user communication  system with M transmit antennas and M users, each with one  antenna. The sum-capacity is [2]: \nwhere I M  is an M×M identity matrix, H is the M×M channel  matrix between every user and the transmitter, and D M  is an \nM×M positive diagonal matrix whose trace is unity. The  elements of H are Rayleigh fading (complex-Gaussian)  coefficients with mean zero and unit variance. Throughout \nWe ignore the numerical and algorithmic issues in  optimizing D M  in (1). \nThe suffix \u201crand\u201d denotes that the users are chosen  randomly from the pool and has operational meaning only  when fewer than M are chosen.  \nThe diagonal elements of D M   in (2)  are related to the  power assigned to different data streams of different users  [2]. Rather surprisingly, we show that the lower bound in  (4) (which assigns equal power to the data streams) is tight  at both high and low  ρ for large M.  When M = 1, this lower  bound is trivially tight. For large  ρ it is shown in [5] that  setting \t (1/ ) M \t M M = D \t I  is a good approximation. When  ρ  is  small, we show in [9] that: \nWe next investigate the sensitivity of C M  to reducing  the number of users K to a value less than M but keeping the \nnumber of antennas fixed at M. We call the resulting  capacity  C K .  The sensitivity of the capacity is determined  by decreasing the number of users by a small amount and  examining how much we must increase the SNR so as to  keep the total capacity constant.  Instead of working directly  on the sum-capacity (which does not have a closed-form \nformula), we use the lower bound I and the general  relationship is as follows:  \nwhere  K  is the design variable representing the number of  users we serve with M antennas.  We would like to find the  difference between C M  and C K  as a function of K and ρ.  We  examine this gap indirectly as shown in equation (6) where  we instead examine the gaps in the two circled inequalities.  As shown in equation (5), we know that I rand,M  is a good  approximation of C M .  Thus, we only need to investigate the \ngap between I rand,M  and I rand,K .  If the difference between  I rand,M  and I rand,K  is small, then we can ensure also that the  difference between C M  and C K  is also small.  \nThe approximation I rand,K  has the big advantage of a  closed-form formula: \nThe approximation of I rand,K   ≈  KF( β, ρ) above is valid  when we consider a fixed  β but both K and M are large [10].  The approximation makes the analysis tractable and is very  accurate for even small values of M and K.  \nWhen we reduce the number of users from K to K \u2032 , the  ratio  β increases to β\u2032, where β\u2032 = M/K\u2032. In order to achieve  the same capacity before this reduction,  ρ must be increased  to some  ρ\u2032. We define two quantities: ε the complexity  reduction coefficient, and  δ the power penalty coefficient.  The quantity  ε is defined as: \nA large positive  ε implies a large reduction in  complexity.  We are generally interested in infinitesimal  changes, and an infinitesimal change in  β is related to an  infinitesimal change in  K through \nthe number of users is halved (i.e.  β\u2032  = 2β).  This is a  notational convenience since it turns out that our final  results are insensitive to the absolute number of antennas  and users but are strong functions of the ratio β. \nA large positive δ implies a large increase in SNR. The  power penalty is related to the dB-change in power through \nwhere the changes in  ρ and β are infinitesimal and such that  the mutual information  I rand,K  is kept constant.  A small  value for this ratio suggests that the number of users can be \nchanged with little penalty in power. To obtain the  sensitivity we solve \nγ β\nβ \t ρβ ρ β\nρ β \t γ β \t β\nand  a and  γ  are defined in (8). A proof of Theorem 1 can be  found in [9]. \nWe notice that sensitivity  δ/ε in (15) is a function of  only  ρ and β and is therefore \u201cuniversal\u201d in the sense that it  does not depend on the specific values of the number of  transmit antennas  M and the number of users K but only  their ratio.  \nThe sensitivity is the ratio of incremental power to user  reduction while achieving constant mutual information.  A  low value of  δ/ε implies that the capacity is insensitive to  the number of users being served; there is only a small  penalty if we serve fewer users. On the other hand, a large  value of  δ/ε implies that the capacity is highly sensitive to  the number of users being served. \nSince the expression of sensitivity in (15) is rather  complex, we look at some special cases and asymptotic  results. For example, when  β = 1 we obtain γ = 0 and we  may simplify (15) to \nWe plot the sensitivity for  β = 1 as given in (19) in  Figure 1. One can see that the sensitivity is never negative  because the mutual information is a non-decreasing function  of the number of users being served. Furthermore, from  Figure 1, the sensitivity for  β = 1 can be separated into two  regions, from  ρ = \u201340dB to 0dB, the sensitivity δ/ε is small  (i.e.  δ/ε << 1), but after ρ = 10dB δ/ε grows quickly. In  Figure 1, we also plot the sensitivity for  β = 2, 4, 8 based on \n(15). We observe from the figure that the sensitivity  increases as  β increases because a larger value of β means  that we are already serving fewer users. \n  Figure 1:   Sensitivity  δ/ε for β = 1, 2, 4, 8.  A low \nWe present the following asymptotics for the  sensitivity: \nFrom (20) one can see that at low  ρ the sensitivity is  linear in  ρ with slope β/2 and goes to zero as ρ goes to zero.   This is seen in Figure 1.  The effect of  β is to increase the  penalty multiplicatively as  β increases, but since ρ is already  small the effect is generally also small.  \nWhen  ρ is large, (21) shows that there are two cases:   β = 1 and β  > 1. The effect of β  > 1 is to shift the curve to \nthe left by ln( β \u2013 1), which can be seen in Figure 1 in the  curves for  β = 2, 4, and 8 at high SNR. \nSuppose  K = M  ( β = 1).  We ask: At what ρ we can  reduce the number of users to be served by ½, ¼, or ⅛  (equivalently, make  β = 2, 4, or 8) while suffering only ≈1  dB power loss? \n   Figure 2:   (upper figure) Sensitivity  δ/ε for β = 1 showing  the points where the power penalty is approximately 1.14 \nThe sensitivity  δ/ε can be used to answer this question.   The complexity reductions  ε in (9) that correspond to  changing  β from 1 to 2, or from 1 to 4, or from 1 to 8 are ε = \n1, 3, and 7.  We choose the power penalty coefficient as  δ =  0.3 since we accept an estimated penalty of 10log 10 (1+0.3) ≈  1.14dB.  The corresponding sensitivities  δ/ε for the three  cases are then 0.3, 0.1, and 0.043.  \nWe obtain the operating point  ρ that yields these  sensitivities by solving  δ/ε in (19) with β = 1.  Figure 2 is a  plot of  δ/ε versus ρ that shows our operating points.   For \nexample, the sensitivity is 0.3 when   ρ = 1dB; this implies  that when  β = 1 there will be a loss of 1.14dB at ρ = 1dB \nwhen  β is increased to 2.  A similar loss is obtained at ρ =   -6dB when  β is increased to 4; at ρ = -10dB when β is  increased to 8.  These predicted values of  ρ are tabulated in \nthe second column of Table 1.  Accepting a loss of  approximately 1.14dB and with M = 8, we can therefore  serve only  K = 4 users ( β = 2) at  ρ = 1dB, K = 2 users (β =  4) at \u20136dB,  K = 1 user ( β = 8) at \u201310dB.  \nWe verify these predicted operating points with the  capacity curves, which are displayed in Figure 3. The actual  power penalty when  β is increased from 1 to 2, 4, or 8,  corresponding to  δ/ε = 0.3, 0.1 and 0.043, is tabulated in the  last column of Table 1. For example, Figure 3 shows that  when  ρ = -6dB, in order to achieve the same throughput as \neight users ( β  = 1) with only two users (β = 4), about  1.30dB of extra power is needed. Similarly for the  remaining two cases.  Hence the exact penalties in  ρ for \nthree cases are close to the estimated values, but the  estimated values are much more readily computed using the  closed-form equation (19). \nThe previous sections show that we can reduce the  number of users at low SNR with only a small power  penalty.  We now show that reducing the number of users in \nsome algorithms improve their performance sufficiently to  overcome this penalty.  We consider a system with M  = 8  transmit antennas and  L = 8 users at a total throughput of 8  bps/Hz.  We use the vector-perturbation technique described  in [8]. Throughout the simulations, it is assumed that rate-\nhalf turbo codes from the UMTS standard with feedforward  polynomial 1+D+D 3 , feedback polynomial 1+ D 2 + D 3 , block  length 10,000 bits, 20 inner iterations, and 8 outer loop  iterations is used [11]. \nThe vector-perturbation technique from [8] is  summarized as follows: \nwhere  y is received signal vectors for all K users, H is  channel matrix, u and n are the signal and noise vectors for  K users, G is the regularized-inverse precoding matrix,  γ is a  scalar such that total transmission power is normalized to  one,  α is the regularized-inverse parameter, |c| max  is the  absolute value of the constellation symbol with largest  magnitude, and ∆ is the spacing between constellation  points. The  perturbation vector  l, which consists of only \n  Figure 4:    BER performance for the case of M = 8 when \nwith regularized-inverse perturbation technique at a total  throughput of 8 bps/Hz is shown in Figure 4. We observe  from Figure 4 that by serving K = 4 users chosen randomly  from the pool of 8 (the black dashed line, where each user  uses a 16QAM constellation, corresponding to a coded rate  of 2bps/Hz per user) can be much better than serving all K =  8 users (the blue dotted line, where each user uses a QPSK  constellation, corresponding to a coded rate of 1bps/Hz per  user). In this particular example, the overall performance  gain is about 1.5dB despite the fact that serving 4 users has  a power penalty of approximately 1.65dB (C 8  vs C 4 ). This \nillustrates the advantages of serving fewer users at low  SNR, as the algorithm performance improvement outweighs  the power penalty.   Furthermore, to serve four users, we  only require the CSI of any four users at a time, instead of  all eight users, and the algorithm complexity decreases  greatly. \nOne can also serve K = 4 selected users (the red solid  line, where each user uses a 16QAM constellation).  The  selection process chooses the set of four users out of eight \nthat maximize the mutual information between the  transmitter and the receiver.  As shown in Figure 4,  selection has the best performance and is only 2dB away \nfrom  C 8 .  The selection process, however, necessarily  requires the CSI of all eight users. \nWe proposed a sensitivity-based method for reducing  the number of users served in a multi-antenna multi-user  system at low SNR.  We showed that the power penalty for  serving a smaller number of users can be small and can, in  fact, be overcome by both performance improvements and  complexity reductions in algorithms that serve these users. \n[1]   G.
