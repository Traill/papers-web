The trafﬁc generated through such applications has been shown to be dominating in the Inter- net [5]. The attraction of these systems, when compared to client/server frameworks, is in their robustness, reliability and cost efﬁciency. Among P2P networks, content distribution (ﬁle swapping) networks (CDNs), such as Kazaa (or \u201cKaZaA\u201d) [4], Gnutella [3], eDonkey [2] and Bit-Torrent [1] are very popu- lar essentially because of their scalability. However, the ratio- nally selﬁsh behavior of users 1 who beneﬁt from communal re- sources but do not cooperate by sharing theirs\u2019 (i.e., free riding) has been shown to cause performance degradation in peer-to- peer CDNs [12], [24], [26], [27].\nReputation systems [9], [20], [17], [28], [23], [14], [22], monetary incentives [21], [25] and rule-based incentives [1], [10], [7], are different approaches proposed to address the free riding phenomena in P2P networks. Participating peers rank each other in response to directly perceived or referred behav- ior. Ideally for a CDN, the most cooperative nodes are those with highest reputation rankings and receive better service in return. Reputations are cumulative in nature and provide indi- rect incentives. On the other hand, monetary incentives more directly reward those who cooperate by sharing resources (e.g., micropayments approach [21], [25]). In rule based incentives, the system itself governs the behavior of the peers by impos- ing rules that force peers to share some of their resources while\ncompensations are obtained by the peers upon their contribu- tions.\nIn [11], [18], [19], peers play a game in hopes of maximiz- ing their own utility (their \u201ccumulative contribution\u201d acts as a reputation). The game is designed so that the peers need to maintain a level of cooperation in sharing their bandwidth re- sources for an equilibrium to exist. We recently [22] introduced a cumulative reputation framework that, for special cases, can be proved to converge in mean to reveal the true propensity of peer nodes to cooperate. Based on this framework, a game was formulated in which users play to maximize the success rate of their queries for ﬁles by adjusting their cooperation level and thereby improving their reputation. A simulation study (consid- ering weighted voting, hierarchical trust groups and misrepre- sentations) showed that all users with a desired goal of a query success rate ≥ 50% were encouraged to cooperate.\nIn this paper we study the behavior of the users in a \u201ccon- tinuous\u201d game where the quality of the service received from peers is measured by the download rate of the desired ﬁles. The peer-reputation ranking system is a simpliﬁed version of that in [22]. We show that the users who cooperate more by sharing more uplink bandwidth [18], [19] achieve a better reputation ranking and eventually a higher net utility. In section II, we in- troduce our game model and highlight the differences between it and previously proposed models. The model is further stud- ied through simulation in section III. Conclusions are drawn in section IV.\nConsider a group of N peer nodes that subject one another to queries for resources, speciﬁcally ﬁles. A query (say from peer i to j) together with a response (j\u2019s response to i\u2019s query) form a transaction. For i = j, let R ij be the normalized reputation of peer j from the point of view of peer i, i.e., for all peers i, it will always be the case that\nAs transactions occur, these reputation states will change. In particular, if i queries j and the subsequent response is that j gives i the requested ﬁle (i.e., responds positively), then R ij\nwill increase. In [22], we survey approaches to securing such a reputation system.\nIn [18], [19], the reputation (\u201ccumulative contribution\u201d) of the peers is incrementally modiﬁed not by a ﬁxed amount ( C) but by an amount equal to the rate at which the ﬁle has received. The following game is a signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of that in [18], [19]; in particular, with regard to their assumptions about user utilities and their reputations, the latter being cumulative net contributions to the P2P system that decline with received con- tent.\nSuppose that each peer i has a ﬁxed aggregate download ca- pacity D i and aggregate upload capacity U i . Each peer i can designate an amount of their uplink capacity u i ≤ U i that is used for contributive/cooperative interaction with the P2P CDN system under consideration. We do not model the user\u2019s \u201ccon- trol variable\u201d u as a ﬁxed total access capacity minus the down- link [18], [19], but as simply bounded by a ﬁxed upper bound on uplink capacity. The system is taken to operate in discrete time according to the query epochs. That is, consider the fol- lowing dynamics for each point in discrete time:\n1) Each peer i queries at most one peer, say j = i (this would occur with probability ρ ij in a simpliﬁed transac- tions model); each requester i is also informed of the cur- rent uplink rate u j of the requestee j. The size of the ﬁle requested is r i . In the following, when the downlink ca- pacity terms d are directly compared with the ﬁle size r terms (or the r terms are called \u201crates\u201d), the r terms will be implicitly assumed to be divided by the unit of discrete time. We assume all requested ﬁle sizes r i ≤ d i .\n2) As a result of the previous step, each peer j is in receipt of a set M j of queries where we note M j may be empty or may have more than one query. Each requester i ∈ M j \u201cdeserves\u201d an allocation\nwhere [z] + ≡ z if z > 0, otherwise [z] + ≡ 0. The idea is to distribute a penalty for excess demand ε only among those users which are requesting more than what they de- serve, i.e., among\n3) Each requester i adjusts their reputation of requestee j, e.g., by adding R ij + cx ji , for some constant c > 0, and then normalizing all reputations stored at i. Note this ad- justment of reputation is a simpliﬁed version of the one introduced in [22].\nObviously, there are many other possible variations of the above method of employing reputations to decide on resource disbursement and then adjusting reputations in response to those decisions. With regard to the former, we assumed that x ji ≤ r i is desired, i.e., requesting peer i ought not receive at a rate larger than requested. Also, under overload conditions, i.e.,\nr k > u j : x ji = r i for all peers i that have high rep- utations R ji and low request r i relative to other peers in M j ; and x ji ≪ r i for all peers i that have low reputations R ji and high request r i relative to other peers in M j . Note that under equations (2) and (3), if there is excessive demand, i.e., ε > 0, then\notherwise x ji = r i for all i ∈ M j (the latter even when M ∗ j = ∅). Another beneﬁt of (2) and (3) is \u201cinitialization,\u201d i.e., a peer with no reputation will be granted a positive uplink capacity, when g(0) < ∞; so, we suggest that selection of the form g(R) ≡ α/R, for ﬁxed α > 0, not be used. In our simulation study, we used\nNote the grants x are continuous in the requests r. Such conti- nuity is necessary for the existence of a ﬁxed-point of the itera- tion by Brouwer\u2019s theorem [8].\nIntuitively, if a user reduces their uplink-rate u, their reputa- tion R will eventually be reduced, and their allocations x will also be reduced during periods of excessive demand, i.e., ε > 0; this is the \u201cincentive\u201d effect that step 3 will subsequently have under equations (2) and (3).\nAt the end of step 3, a requestee can assess the value obtained from the CDN from the result x of the current transaction (or by an accumulation of past and present results) via a utility func- tion, i.e., V i (x i /r i ) 2 . The utility is typically assumed to be nondecreasing but concave (law of diminishing returns) with V (0) = 0 [15]. This utility can be compared against the cost of participating in the CDN that, in this case, could be a function of the access capacity κ i . A game can then be formulated where, e.g., peers iteratively adjust typically constrained control vari- ables, say u i ≤ κ i with κ i ﬁxed (and therefore d i = κ i − u i ). This adjustment would occur immediately after step 3 with a \u201cgreedy\u201d local objective to maximize their unimodal net utility. More precisely, over the interval [nT, (n + 1)T − 1] (i.e., T transactions), each user i assesses the effect of their choice of uplink-rate u i (n) at time nT on their net utility\nis the total download over the interval (alternatively, a mean download or mean download divided by requested rate, could be used for example), and x i (k) is the download of user i at time/transaction k (note that clearly x i (k) = 0 if the k th trans- action does not involve peer i querying another peer), and a is a constant capturing the user\u2019s relative valuation of utility V and uplink u allocated to the peer-to-peer network.\nWriting X i as a function u i (clearly, X i is also a function u j for all j = i), we also assume that\nThe interval T needs to be assumed sufﬁciently large to observe enough transactions to accurately make these assess- ments; clearly, the choice of T could be user-dependent but in the following simpliﬁed simulation we assume that it is com- mon to all users and that the uplink-rate updates are synchro- nized among the users. We assumed that each user i sequen- tially modify their constrained uplink-rate u i ∈ [1, U max i ] to try to maximize their net utility ν i using a distributed annealing strategy [16], [13], [6].\nModeling research on the demand processes of P2P CDNs is only in its preliminary stages and that games allow us to model dynamic user iteration with the P2P system (including the query-resolution/routing protocol). Clearly, given the i th peer\u2019s demand for a ﬁle, it will prefer to query peers j (who possess that ﬁle) which have larger reputations R ij and uplink capacities u j . So, instead of ﬁxed values, in a more realistic setting we would expect the ρ ij to be increasing functions of R ij and u j . For simplicity in the following simulation study, we assumed that successive query-response transactions were mutually independent and the speciﬁc transaction ij occurred with probability ρ ij .\nIn our simulation study of N = 100 peer nodes with equally likely transactions, nodes assessed their selection of contributed uplink-rate at the end of each interval by calculating their net utility (5). We considered two cases for the utilities V with V max i = U max i = 1000kbps for all i:\nwhere ξ is the total amount received, X, by i divided by the total amount requested, k r i (k), by i in an interval. Peers dynami- cally chose uplinks between 1kbps and U max when the parame- ter a specifying the relative cost of uplink bandwidth in (5) was approximately 0.01 ( a = 0.007 in our reported simulations). To ensure congestion in the simulated peers, we either randomly chose the requested transfer rate r i ∈ [u j /(2P ), u j /P ] (where P was the number of concurrent requesting peers at all nodes on average) or r i = u j /2.\nThe reputation values for each peer from the point of view of another were all randomly initialized and normalized (1). Each peer i also randomly initialized its uplink bandwidth u i ∈ [1, U max i ]. Intervals T were chosen to be either 1000 and 2500 transactions long.\nThe simulations were performed for a total of 200 rounds, each divided into a \u201dquery process\u201d and \u201dresponse process\u201d. At the beginning of each round, F unique pairs of nodes were se- lected at random and one peer in each pair queried the other; these are ordered pairs chosen from a set of size N (N − 1). Note that query resolution was not covered in this work and peers were assumed to be made aware of the location of the ﬁles they desired. This process resulted in an average of F/N queries per node per round. Then, in the response process, the queried peers evaluated their excess demand and prepared to download ﬁles to the requesters at rates calculated based on step 2 in section II. The querying peers i, upon receipt of the requested resource at rate x ji from the queried/provider peer j, modiﬁed j\u2019s reputation according to step 3 above. We chose C = 0.0001 because we found that this value was not too large so that a peer derived too much reputation beneﬁt from a single transaction (so that it would not need to be as cooperative for a long time thereafter) and not too small so giving negligle incen- tive to cooperate. Note that unlike the reputation model in [22], we used only local reputation values (instead of mean pooled reputations) to govern future transactions.\nSuccessive rounds were grouped into intervals of a total of T transactions. At the end of each interval, all nodes evaluated their net utilities (5) to decide how to modify their uplink band- widths u for the next interval. These decisions were assumed to be performed synchronously. Utilities were calculated based on the cumulative received rate x and cumulative request rate r during the past interval. The following distributed anneal- ing strategy [16], [13], [6] was used where the \u201ctemperature\u201d ζ > 0, the uplink step-size γ > 0, and the interval index n ≥ 1. 0.1 Uplink rates are initialized: u i (0) ∈ [1, U max i ] for all peers\n0.2 After an initial interval of T transactions, the initial net utility ν i (0) is calculated for all peers i.\nn.1 A candidate uplink rate u \u2032 (n) is assigned to each node to be used in the n th interval: if 1+γ ≤ u i (n−1) ≤ U max − γ,\n \nu i (n − 1) \t with probability 1/3 u i (n − 1) + γ with probability 1/3 u i (n − 1) − γ with probability 1/3\nn.2 After an interval of T transactions, the net utilities ν \u2032 i (n) and the differences δ i ≡ ν \u2032 i (n) − ν i (n − 1) are calculated.\nn.3 If δ ≥ 0, u \u2032 i (n) is accepted, i.e., set u i (n) = u \u2032 i (n); other- wise, it is only accepted with probability exp(δ i /ζ).\nIn ﬁgures 1 through 4, γ = 5, ζ = 1 and the unbounded utilities were used by all peers. Also, the requested rates obeyed r i = u j /2 to create congestion at the nodes (random selection of r i ∈ [u j /(2P ), u j /P ] with P = 5 was shown to create less congestion and hence fewer peers were encouraged to increase their uplink-rates (cooperate)).\nFigures 1 and 2 depict the sample path behavior of peers in this dynamic network environment with T = 1000 total trans- actions per interval consisting of 2 rounds of F = 500 par- allel transactions per interval. The peer in Figure 1, gener- ally reduced his uplink bandwidth resulting in an only slightly reduced net utility. However, the mean reputation value of the peer decreased very sharply at the beginning mainly be- cause: the initial uplink choice of 205kbps was fairly low ( U max = 1000kbps) and the adjustment size γ was small. After\nabout 10 4 transactions, the reputation values changed less dras- tically. In ﬁgure 2, this node also began with a low uplink value (similarly, a sudden decrease in the reputation ranking resulted) but more constantly adjusted to higher uplink values. Net utili- ties were slightly higher on average than those of the aforemen- tioned user while reputations in the steady state tended to be larger.\nExamples more clearly demonstrating these \u201cincentive\u201d trends of the reputation system are given in Figures 3 through\n4 wherein intervals of T = 2500 (5 rounds of F = 500 parallel transactions per interval) were used instead. Less drastic initial changes in the reputation values are due to the moderate initial uplink value for the user of ﬁgure 4. In ﬁgure 3, the reputation value initially increases rapidly because the initial uplink of this user was relatively high.\nSimulation results using bounded utilities were similar to those reported above. Also, other sets of experiments were per- formed with different parameters. For larger temperatures, e.g., ζ = 100, changes in the uplink resulting in lower net utility are more likely to be accepted. As might be expected, the nodes re- sponded much more slowly to the network dynamics and faced either gradual increase or decrease in the uplink-rate instead of oscillations. this resulted in corresponding changes in net utilities and reputation values but more gradually and with less oscillations. The sudden initial changes in the reputation values were observed as before if the initial uplink was chosen too high or two low. Finally, we also used a gradient ascent approach, in- stead of distributed annealing, with signiﬁcantly poorer results. We postulate that the reason for this is that a given peer\u2019s net utility depends on the uplinks of all other peers, all of which potentially change each interval, and that performance of gra- dient ascent degrades more signiﬁcantly when the optimized function itself (the net utility) changes (possibly related prob- lems involving poor local maxima are also a factor).\nA distributed, cumulative reputation system was used to en- courage cooperation among participants in a peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing system. The actions of peer nodes were modeled with a continuous game in which users modiﬁed the amount of up- link bandwidth they allocate to the network. We demonstrated by simulation that increasing uplink bandwidth (cost) results in improved reputation that will, in turn, result in improved down- loading performance (beneﬁt).\nIn the future, we plan to explore the potential beneﬁts of us- ing reputation values averaged over peers [22] in order to reduce volatility. In addition, we will study distributed and automated tuning of the many parameters that are in play so as to make the reputation system more responsive thereby reducing the delay between a peer\u2019s action (uplink bandwidth) and its appropri- ate effect on the peer\u2019s utility. Finally, we will consider other applications of peer-to-peer systems such as distributed compu- tation."},"refs":[{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Bit-torrent"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":""}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Gnutella"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Kazaa"}},{"authors":[],"title":{"text":"Top applications (bytes) for subinterface 0[0]: Sd-nap trafﬁc"}},{"authors":[{"name":"E.
