Creation of musical patterns often involves splicing the notes in a constrained way resulting in aesthetically sounding music. We develop an approach for music signal representation based on symbolic dynamics by translating the lexicographic rules over a musical scale to constraints on a Markov chain. This representation is useful for machine based music synthesis similar to a musician producing original music. To mathematically quantify user listening experience, we study the correlation between the max-entropic rate of a musical scale and the subjective aesthetic component. We present examples for the south Indian classical music."},"body":{"text":""},"refs":[]},"file":{"jsonClass":"File","file":"/home/arnfred/Code/trailhead/resources/ita2013/3001"},"links":[{"id":"205","weight":3},{"id":"1486","weight":2},{"id":"67","weight":2},{"id":"1606","weight":2},{"id":"153","weight":2},{"id":"3037","weight":3},{"id":"436","weight":3},{"id":"12","weight":2},{"id":"1278","weight":6},{"id":"2287","weight":2},{"id":"3200","weight":3},{"id":"3083","weight":2},{"id":"3010","weight":2},{"id":"1430","weight":4},{"id":"3021","weight":2},{"id":"170","weight":7},{"id":"3069","weight":2},{"id":"2634","weight":2},{"id":"2442","weight":2},{"id":"2763","weight":5},{"id":"702","weight":6},{"id":"3182","weight":2},{"id":"1889","weight":4},{"id":"3154","weight":3},{"id":"3065","weight":4},{"id":"3195","weight":4},{"id":"1060","weight":2},{"id":"3132","weight":3},{"id":"3187","weight":2},{"id":"944","weight":2},{"id":"104","weight":3},{"id":"90","weight":2},{"id":"236","weight":5},{"id":"33","weight":2},{"id":"3111","weight":2},{"id":"2352","weight":2},{"id":"3176","weight":4},{"id":"470","weight":2},{"id":"1643","weight":2},{"id":"3135","weight":2},{"id":"123","weight":8},{"id":"3049","weight":2},{"id":"1479","weight":2},{"id":"1223","weight":3},{"id":"1473","weight":4},{"id":"1462","weight":2},{"id":"13","weight":2},{"id":"2119","weight":2},{"id":"888","weight":2},{"id":"1436","weight":2},{"id":"3186","weight":2},{"id":"1107","weight":2},{"id":"2697","weight":2},{"id":"398","weight":2},{"id":"3105","weight":4},{"id":"2488","weight":4},{"id":"59","weight":2},{"id":"353","weight":5},{"id":"1846","weight":5},{"id":"3168","weight":2},{"id":"263","weight":2},{"id":"1103","weight":2},{"id":"76","weight":2},{"id":"419","weight":4},{"id":"372","weight":3},{"id":"1660","weight":3},{"id":"628","weight":3},{"id":"408","weight":3},{"id":"1696","weight":4},{"id":"1212","weight":5},{"id":"1096","weight":2},{"id":"642","weight":2},{"id":"3196","weight":2},{"id":"1830","weight":3},{"id":"691","weight":2},{"id":"1443","weight":3},{"id":"2812","weight":8},{"id":"3243","weight":2},{"id":"2188","weight":4},{"id":"445","weight":3},{"id":"1671","weight":4},{"id":"1325","weight":2},{"id":"2319","weight":2},{"id":"431","weight":2},{"id":"1376","weight":3},{"id":"3174","weight":3},{"id":"3051","weight":2},{"id":"1988","weight":3},{"id":"2884","weight":4},{"id":"25","weight":2},{"id":"2743","weight":2},{"id":"687","weight":3},{"id":"230","weight":2},{"id":"2177","weight":2},{"id":"2773","weight":2},{"id":"151","weight":3},{"id":"95","weight":4},{"id":"184","weight":5},{"id":"3030","weight":2},{"id":"3205","weight":2},{"id":"75","weight":2},{"id":"115","weight":2},{"id":"3197","weight":2},{"id":"767","weight":4},{"id":"326","weight":3},{"id":"1076","weight":8},{"id":"1915","weight":2},{"id":"1233","weight":3},{"id":"3189","weight":3},{"id":"831","weight":3},{"id":"2862","weight":2},{"id":"402","weight":3},{"id":"1102","weight":2},{"id":"2753","weight":2},{"id":"1319","weight":3},{"id":"699","weight":5},{"id":"187","weight":3},{"id":"165","weight":5},{"id":"1627","weight":3},{"id":"621","weight":2},{"id":"261","weight":2},{"id":"438","weight":4},{"id":"3198","weight":3},{"id":"2778","weight":3},{"id":"1861","weight":3},{"id":"3129","weight":3},{"id":"3133","weight":6},{"id":"3184","weight":2},{"id":"3044","weight":2},{"id":"3170","weight":2},{"id":"2738","weight":4},{"id":"782","weight":2},{"id":"323","weight":3},{"id":"74","weight":2},{"id":"1231","weight":3},{"id":"1214","weight":3},{"id":"3114","weight":2},{"id":"449","weight":2},{"id":"377","weight":4},{"id":"424","weight":3},{"id":"2146","weight":2},{"id":"2315","weight":3},{"id":"1680","weight":3},{"id":"3208","weight":3},{"id":"2299","weight":3},{"id":"1258","weight":2},{"id":"2286","weight":4},{"id":"752","weight":2},{"id":"1393","weight":3},{"id":"1714","weight":3}],"meta":{"jsonClass":"Map$Map3","room":"The Boardroom","date":"1360748700000","session":"4"},"cluster":{"jsonClass":"Map$EmptyMap$"}}
