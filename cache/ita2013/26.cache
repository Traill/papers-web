The questions that the sequential decoder can ask are of the type \u201cIs this node the correct node at level N ?\u201d to which the genie provides a truthful \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer. Every false guess increases the complexity counter by one unit and the search continues until the sequential decoder ﬁnds the correct node and advances to the next level in the tree. The result in [3] states that (under certain technical conditions), the number of questions C N that the decoder must ask to determine the correct node at level N has a Paretian distribution,\nwhere the parameter ρ ≥ 0 is determined by the rate R of the code. For R < R 0 , ρ > 1 and the expectation of C N is bounded for all N ≥ 1. On the other hand, for R > R 0 , ρ < 1 and the expectation of C N grows without bound as N is increased.\nIn part due to its role as the cutoff rate of sequential decoding and in part due to its appearance in the union bound on the probability of error for communication systems in general, the parameter R 0 appeared prominently in the communications engineering literature in sixties and seventies. The classical book by Wozencraft and Jacobs [4] uses R 0 extensively as a practical measure of quality for signaling systems. Sequential decoding also was discussed in great detail by the information theory and coding books that were written in this period, notably, [4], [5], [6]. The argument in favor of R 0 as a practical parameter of communication was put forward lucidly in [7] and [8]. Communication at rates near R 0 appeared a reasonable and practically viable objective while achieving channel capacity appeared an unrealistic goal.\nThe notion of cutoff rate as a practical limit to achievable rates has been challenged from the very beginning. Pinsker [9] gave a method that combined sequential decoding and block codes to achieve channel capacity. Falconer [10] also devised a system using Reed-Solomon codes and sequential decod- ing that achieved channel capacity. Although these methods showed that the cutoff rate was not a fundamental barrier, they were too complicated at the time to have much practical impact.\nA paper by Massey [11] revealed a truly interesting aspect of the cutoff rate by showing that it could be \u201ccreated\u201d by\nbe expected due to Gallager\u2019s parallel channels theorem [5, p.149]. On the other hand, it is not clear if an arbitrary channel can be readily split into subchannels, as the QEC was split into two BEC\u2019s. To facilitate channel splitting, we propose channel combining as a preliminary step before splitting is applied. We illustrate this idea by two examples in this section.\nExample 1 (BEC): Let V : X → Y be a BEC with alphabets X = {0, 1}, Y = {0, 1, ?}, and erasure probability ǫ. Consider combining two copies of V as shown in Fig. 2. In the ﬁgure, ⊕ denotes addition modulo-2. The combined channel is a DMC W : X 2 → Y 2 with transition probabilities W (y 1 y 2 |u 1 u 2 ) = V (y 1 |u 1 ⊕ u 2 )V (y 2 |u 2 ). For cutoff rate\ncalculations we need to assign a probability distribution on the inputs (u 1 , u 2 ) of the channel W . We use the assignment (U 1 , U 2 ) ∼ Q 1 (u 1 )Q 2 (u 2 ) where Q 1 , Q 2 are uniform on {0, 1}. This assignment is consistent with a coding scheme where the inputs u 1 and u 2 of W are encoded independently, as in Massey\u2019s scheme. In Massey\u2019s scheme the decoder is also split into two non-communicating decoders; it turns out this is too strong a condition for achieving cutoff rate gains in general. We also split the decoding task, but allow the decoders communicate with each other in a decision feed-\nR 0 (U 1 ; Y 1 Y 2 ) = 1 − log(1 + 2ǫ − ǫ 2 ) R 0 (U 2 ; Y 1 Y 2 U 1 ) = 1 − log(1 + ǫ 2 )\n1−ǫ and ǫ, respectively. Decoder 1 sees effectively the channel U 1 → U 1 ⊕E 1 ⊕E 2 , which is a BSC with crossover probability ǫ 2 = 2ǫ(1 − ǫ) and has cutoff rate\nDecoder 2 sees the channel U 2 → Y 1 Y 2 U 1 , which is equivalent to the channel U 2 → (Y 1 ⊕ U 1 , Y 2 ) = (U 2 ⊕ E 1 , U 2 ⊕ E 2 ), which in turn is a BSC with diversity order 2 and has cutoff rate\nThus, the sum cutoff rate with this splitting scheme is given by\nwhich is larger than 2R 0 (V ) for all 0 < ǫ < 1/2, as shown in Fig. 4.\nExtensions of these channel combining methods can be found in [17] and [16]. The above examples illustrate the main point that signiﬁcant gains in cutoff rate can be achieved with negligible extra system complexity.\nWe have given a brief survey of the notion of cutoff rate as regards its fundamental nature for communication systems. We pointed out the fundamental nature of the cutoff rate in relation to the computation problem in sequential decoding by citing the main result of [3]. Next, we reviewed Massey\u2019s example to show that the cutoff rate can be exceeded without any difﬁculty even by sequential decoding itself if one uses more than one sequential decoder. Finally, we have given a brief description of a general method for improving the cutoff rates of arbitrary DMC\u2019s."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"J. M. Wozencraf"},{"name":"B.
