Specifically, the paper characterizes the backoff from the Han-Kobayashi achievable rate region for the DM-IC when the blocklength is finite but sufficiently large.  The achievable dispersions can be represented by information variances of eight information densities. Using a generalized dependence testing bound, the first-order and second-order statistics of the eight information densities are shown to characterize an inner bound on the ($n$, $\\epsilon_1$, $\\epsilon_2$)-capacity region of the DM-IC, where $n$ is a given finite blocklength, and $\\epsilon_1$ and $\\epsilon_2$ are desired average probabilities of error at receivers $1$ and $2$, respectively."},"body":{"text":"Linear dispersion (LD) codes introduced in [1] are a good candidate for high data rate MIMO signaling over wireless channels. Traditionally LD codes only optimize the average mutual infor- mation; and therefore cannot guarantee good er- ror performance. More recently, another scheme called threaded algebraic space-time (TAST) coding has been proposed [2, 3]. The design of\nthe TAST focuses on the worst-case pairwise er- ror probability (PEP). The PEP, however, may not be the best performance metric, since it is not true in general that the codes optimized with respect to the worst case PEP will end up with the minimum bit or block error rate.\nIn this paper, we we design LD codes with minimum bit/block error probability based on stochastic approximation together with gradient estimation. Most work on space-time code de- sign assumes maximum likelihood decoding. For very high data rate signaling, even the sphere decoder might be too complicated to implement in practice. It is diﬃcult to design space-time codes where a suboptimal decoder (such as the nulling and cancellation decoder) as the perfor- mance analysis seems intractable. One advan- tage of the proposed method is that we can opti- mize the LD codes for an arbitrary decoder. On the other hand, in MIMO wireless systems, the individual antennas could be correlated due to insuﬃcient antenna spacing and lack of scatter- ing. We demonstrate how to design optimal LD codes if the long-term spatial correlation can be measured beforehand. Finally, we present simu- lation results to demonstrate that the LD codes obtained using the proposed design procedure generally outperform the codes designed based on the algebraic number theory, especially when a suboptimal decoder is employed or when the MIMO channels are spatially correlated.\nIn this section we present the signal model for MIMO systems employing LD codes, and for- mulate the LD design problem as a constrained stochastic optimization problem.\nConsider a MIMO system with M T transmit an- tennas and M R receive antennas. Assume that the channel is ﬂat fading and remains constant for τ symbol intervals. The input output relation is given in matrix form by\nwhere Y is the τ ×M R matrix of the received sig- nal, X is the τ × M T matrix of the transmitted signal, W is the τ × M R matrix of the additive white Gaussian noise, and H is the M T × M R MIMO channel matrix composed of i.i.d. circu- larly symmetric complex Gaussian random vari- ables with zero mean and unit variance.\nLD codes use a linear modulation framework and the transmitted codeword is a linear com- bination of certain dispersion matrices with the transmitted symbols as the combining coeﬃ- cients. Assume we transmit Q r-QAM symbols {s q } Q q=1 over τ symbol intervals, the LD trans- mission matrix X is given by [1]\nwhere we have decomposed the transmitted sym- bols s q into their real and imaginary parts, i.e., s q = α q + jβ q , q = 1, · · · , Q, and {A q , B q } Q q=1 are complex-valued dispersion matrices of di- mension τ × M T that specify the code. The rate of the LD code is R = Q log 2 r τ . We also assume that the dispersion matrices {A q , B q } Q q=1 satisfy the following energy constraint\nAs in [1], we denote Y R = Re{Y } and Y I = Im{Y }. Denote the columns Y R , Y I , H R , H I , W R and W I , respectively, by y R,n , y I,n , h R,n , h I,n , w R,n and w I,n ; and deﬁne A q =\nand Y I to form the single real-valued system of equations [1]\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n(4) where the equivalent 2M R τ × 2Q real-valued channel matrix H is given by\n \n(5) From (2) we can see that LD codes are very sim- ple to encode. Furthermore, LD codes can be decoded very eﬃciently either by a polynomial- time maximum likelihood decoder, i.e., the sphere decoder; or by suboptimal decoders, e.g., the nulling and cancellation decoder.\nThe LD codes introduced in [1] are designed to maximize the average mutual information be- tween the input and output. However maxi- mizing the average mutual information does not necessarily lead to better performance in terms of error rate. Unfortunately, the average bit or block error rate is hard to analyze for arbi- trary LD codes. Simulation optimization turns out to be useful is this scenario. In this work, we demonstrate how to optimize the average bit error rate (BER) for LD codes through simula- tion optimization with gradient estimation. The block error performance can be optimized simi- larly. First, we denote h = h T 1 , . . . , h T M R T , and denote the set of dispersion matrices as θ = {A q , B q , q = 1, . . . , Q}. With a slight abuse of notation, we also use θ to denote the column vector that stacks all the columns of A R,q , A I,q , B R,q , and B I,q , for q = 1, . . . , Q. Note that θ is a (4τ M T Q)-dimensional vector.\nLet y n denote the nth block of the received signal corresponding to the nth block of trans- mitted signal x n and channel h n , n = 1, 2, . . ..\nLet γ (y n , x n , h n , θ) denote the empirical BER for a given set of dispersion matrices θ. That is,\nNote that for ﬁxed θ, since {y n , x n , h n } is an i.i.d. sequence, {γ (y n , x n , h, θ)} is also an i.i.d. sequence of random variables. For a given set of dispersion matrices θ, the average BER denoted by Υ (θ) is given by\nΥ (θ) = E {γ (y, x, h, θ)} \t (7) = \t γ (y, x, h, θ) p (y, x, h | θ) dydxdh,\nwhere p (y, x, h | θ) is the joint probability den- sity function (pdf) of (y, x, h) for a given θ. The integrals in (7) are over the space R 2M R τ (for y), A 2Q (for x), where A is the discrete set of real- valued constellation symbols that elements of x take value from, and R 2M R M T (for h), respec- tively. For notational simplicity we subsequently omit the space over which these integrals are de- ﬁned.\nAim: The design goal is to solve the follow- ing constrained stochastic optimization problem: Given the sequence of empirical BER measure- ments γ (y n , x n , h n , θ) for any choice of θ, ﬁnd the optimal set of dispersion matrices to mini- mize the average BER, i.e., compute\nLet θ ∗ denote a local minimum of (8) subject to the constraint (9). From (7), we have\nRemark 1: Because p (y | x, h, θ) is Gaussian (as we will show later), and it is continuously diﬀerentiable in θ, it follows that Υ (θ) is con- tinuously diﬀerentiable in θ. ( This point will be clear in the next section.) Hence Υ (θ) at- tains a minimum on the compact set Θ and the optimization problem (8)-(9) is well posed.\nRemark 2: Note that an explicit closed-form ex- pression for the average BER Υ (θ) is usually not available. Indeed, Υ (θ) also depends on the particular decoder employed (e.g., ML decoder or suboptimal decoder). We will use a stochas- tic gradient algorithm that uses measurements of the empirical BER γ (y n , x n , h n , θ) to compute the optimal LD code θ ∗ . On the other hand,\nθΥ (θ) cannot be computed analytically. We therefore need to devise a scheme that estimates the gradient θΥ (θ) using the empirical BER measurements γ (y n , x n , h n , θ).\nRecall that the dimension of θ is 4τ M T Q. De- note d = 4τ M T Q In this subsection, we pa- rameterize the dispersion matrices θ by spher- ical coordinates ψ ∈ R d−1 . We show that under these spherical coordinates ψ the constrained op- timization (8)-(9) transforms to the equivalent unconstrained optimization problem. This in turn implies that we can present a simple conver- gence proof without requiring any form of pro- jection of the estimates which typically makes convergence proofs for stochastic approximation algorithms very diﬃcult.\nConsider θ(ψ) parameterized by ψ ∈ R d−1 . Here the spherical coordinate ψ = [Ψ 1 , . . . , Ψ d−1 ] T ∈ R d−1 , such that\nNote that the transformation from θ to ψ is in- vertible. Therefore, the constrained optimiza- tion (8)-(9) in θ is equivalent to an unconstrained one in ψ:\nWe propose the following two-stage simulation algorithm to generate the gradient estimate g (ψ).\nAlgorithm 1 [Composite-score function algo- rithm] Given the set of dispersion matrices θ(ψ k ) at the k-th iteration, perform the following simula- tion steps:\n\u2022 Composition method to generate mixture sample :\n1.

As mentioned before, our code design depends on the operating SNR. In the fol- lowing examples, we design the codes by choos- ing the SNR so that the BER is around 10 −2 . We will see that the codes optimized for a par- ticular SNR work ﬁne for a whole range of SNR of interest.\nExample 1\u2013 New LD codes with maximum- likelihood decoder: We ﬁrst present simulation results for i.i.d. fading channels using the sphere decoder. We consider a system with three trans- mit antennas and two receive antennas. Figure 1 shows the BER performance of the new LD codes and the TAST codes employing 16QAM constellations. The rate R is 8 bits/sec/Hz. It is seen that the new codes perform better than the TAST codes for the entire range of SNR. Note that the new LD codes have the same encoding and decoding complexity as the TAST codes.\nExample 2\u2013 New LD codes with nulling and can- cellation decoder: In this example we consider\nFigure 1: BER performance of the new LD code and the TAST code in 3 × 2 uncorrelated MIMO channel with and 16QAM constellation.\ndesigning LD codes for suboptimal decoders, in particular, the zero-forcing nulling and cancel- lation decoder. We also assume i.i.d. fading channels. In Fig. 2 we present the BER per- formance of the new code optimized for four transmit antennas and one receive antenna with 16QAM constellation. We also show the perfor- mance of the DAST code and a randomly gen- erated LD codes. The gain of the new LD code can be clearly seen. The rate R is kept to be 4 bits/sec/Hz.\nFigure 2: BER performance of the new LD code and the DAST code in 4 × 1 uncorrelated MIMO channel with and 16QAM constellation.\nExample 3\u2013 New LD codes for spatially cor- related Rayleigh fading channels: Finally we give an example of the optimal LD codes for spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channels. We consider a 2 × 2 MIMO channel with spa-\ntial correlation at both the transmitter and the receiver. The correlation matrices are given by S = R = \t 1 \t 0.7 + 0.7j 0.7 − 0.7j \t 1 \t . We as- sume QPSK constellation is employed so the data rate is R = 4 bits/sec/Hz. Fig. 3 shows the BER performance of the LD code obtained by Algorithm 2 over this correlated MIMO channel. In the same ﬁgure we also show the performance of the TAST code. Note that although for 2 × 2 i.i.d. fading channels using QPSK constellation, the LD codes obtained by Algorithm 2 performs roughly the same as the TAST code, however, in the presence of spatial correlation, the new LD codes outperforms the TAST code considerably.\nFigure 3: BER performance of the new LD code and the TAST code in 2 × 2 correlated MIMO channel with QPSK constellation."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"B.
