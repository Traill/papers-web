This requires the knowledge of the \"neighborhood scale\", epsilon, or alternatively of the average number of nearest neighbors at that scale. Most of what is known about setting the scale parameter epsilon is asymptotic, in the form of rates of change depending of unknown manifold parameters.  We consider the problem of setting epsilon based on the actual data, and offer a solution that is both practical and principled.  We do this by exploiting the connection between manifold geometry, represented by the Riemannian metric, and the Laplace-Beltrami operator, to optimze how the graph Laplacian preserves the geometry of the data. Experiments show that our method is effective and robust."},"body":{"text":"A mosaic process formalizes the idea of throwing down sets at random. Suppose n is a parameter considered large and S n is a random set of the Euclidean plane governed by a law L n parametrized by n. For our purposes, we think of S n as a small, plump random set centred at the origin and whose size decreases (in a suitable probabilistic sense) as n increases. While not essential, it will be convenient to suppose that the distribution L n of S n is unchanged with respect to rotations of the axes.\nThe simplest illustration is provided by discs and, to ﬁx ideas, we may suppose that the random set S n is a disc of random radius R, centred at the origin, and governed by law F n (r). We formalize the idea that the random sets get increasingly small as n increases by imposing an asymp- totic condition on the coverage; for instance, the condition\nr 2 dF n (r) → 0 as n → ∞ says that the expected radius and the expected area of coverage of the random discs S n vanish asymptotically.\nNow suppose X 1 , . . . , X n is a collection of random points in the unit disc. We think of n as a large parameter. For each X k we pick a random set S n,k distributed as S n , independent for different X k . Then the mosaic process n k=1 (X k + S n,k ) represents a collection of many small random sets thrown down at random.\nThe mosaic process induces a geometric random digraph G = G n, L n . The vertices of G are the points X 1 , . . . , X n . For each k, we associate the directed edge (X k , X l ) originating from X k and terminating in X l for all points X l ∈ X k + S n,k that are not X k itself.\nThe simplest setting for the mosaic and the induced graph occurs when S n is a disc of ﬁxed radius r n . In this case the\nmosaic is formed by n identical copies of discs of radius r n distributed randomly in the unit disc. The graph that obtains is then an ordinary undirected graph with points connected by edges if, and only if, they are within Euclidean distance r n of each other. Such graphs were ﬁrst studied by Gilbert [1] and are called geometric random graphs. In recent years these models have seen renewed interest spurred by applications in computational geometry, randomly deployed sensor networks, and cluster analysis; see the monograph by Penrose for a slew of references [6].\nThe digraph induced by a general mosaic process gener- alises this idea of a geometric random graph by replacing the \u201cdisc of inﬂuence of radius r n \u201d at each point X k by a random \u201cregion of inﬂuence\u201d deﬁned by the random set S n,k placed at that location. The edges of the digraph are directed as associations are not, in general, commutative: if X l ∈ X k + S n,k it is not necessary that X k ∈ X l + S n,l .\nThe general mosaic process may be used to model con- nectivity in a randomly deployed sensor network to account for observed asymmetries in connectivity between elements. Differing transmission powers at the sensors, for instance, may be modelled by placing random discs at each sensor, the radius determined by the available power at the sensor. More generally, a typical foliated antenna pattern with a fat main lobe may be scaled by random amounts to account for differing transmission powers, and provided with a random rotation to account for a random orientation on deployment at each sensor.\nA vertex X k of the digraph G n, L n is isolated if there are no other points X l in the set X k + S n,k . The key implication to connectivity of the underlying graph is the discovery of the feature that as the coverage of the random sets S n decreases there is an abrupt appearance of isolated vertices in the graph.\nRoughly speaking, suppose the random sets S n are Lebesgue measurable and have area A n = A(S n ). Write ψ n = E e −nA n /π for the Laplace transform of the distri- bution of A n . Interactions at the boundary of the unit disc make for ﬁerce complications and are ultimately negligible in the range of interest. We ﬁnesse these details here by calling the random sets S n \u201cregular\u201d and reserve the gory details for elsewhere. The random disc model may serve as a\nuseful guide to focus thought. The main result: for regular mosaic processes, the number of isolated vertices in the induced geometric random digraph has an asymptotic Poisson distribution with mean e −c if log ψ n + log n → c. Here c is an arbitrary real constant.\nThe Poisson approximation ideas behind the proof are classical and follow the approach outlined in Kunniyur and Venkatesh [3], [4]. The key ideas may be sketched quite simply.\nIf we ignore complications at the boundary of the unit disc, the probability that a given point X k is isolated in the graph G n, L n is given by E 1 − A n,k /π n−1 ∼ ψ n with suitable asymptotic regularity conditions on the random sets. For any given k, the sets X i 1 + S n,i 1 , . . . , X i k + S n,i k will with high probability be non-overlapping so that the probability that each of X i 1 , . . . , X i k is isolated is asymptotic to σ n,k := E 1 − 1 π k j=1 A n,i j n−k ∼ ψ k n so that vertex isolations are asymptotically independent. Then S n,k := n k σ n,k → e −kc /k! and the inclusion-exclusion formula shows that the probability that there are exactly m isolated vertices is given by\nIn words, the number of isolated vertices is asymptotically Poisson with mean e −c .\nAs in the classical Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph models, isolated vertices are the main agents for the loss of connectivity and a Peierls argument shows that the probability that the digraph G n, L n is strongly connected tends to e −e −c . We provide details elsewhere.\nWhen the mosaic is built up of ﬁxed discs of radius r n , the condition on ψ n translates into an explicit threshold for the radius: if r 2 n = log n n + c n + o 1 n then the probability that the corresponding geometric random graph is connected tends to e −e −c . Results of this stripe were obtained by Penrose [5] for random points in the unit square, and more generally, in the unit cube in d-dimensions, using the Stein-Chen method of Poisson approximation. An application in the sensory network context was outlined by Gupta and Kumar [2] for random points deployed in a disc.\nVertex extinctions were considered by Kunniyur and Venkatesh [3], [4] as a means of modelling sensor death in a sensor network. Suppose point X k and the associated random set X k + S n,k are deleted after a random time T k . We suppose the random variables T 1 , . . . , T n are independent and subscribe to a common law G(t) = G L n (t) which may be parametrised by the parameters of the mosaic process, for instance, the mean diameter of the random sets. If we start with a strongly connected digraph, as vertices are extinguished the graph devolves: ﬁrst isolated vertices and then regions of isolation, or lacunae, centred at the vertices begin to appear. Write φ n (t) := E e −nA n G Ln (t)/π . Then, under the same\nconditions of regularity of the random sets, if the sequence of time epochs {t n } satisﬁes log φ(t n )+log n → c then the num- ber of isolated vertices at time t n is asymptotically Poisson with mean e −c . Arguments similar to those of Kunniyur and Venkatesh [3], [4] may be adduced to obtain a similar Poisson law for lacunae of a given size. Thus, lacunae emerge abruptly at a critical time determined by the parametrised extinction process.\nThe author gratefully acknowledges the NSF Cybertrust program for support of this work."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"E.
