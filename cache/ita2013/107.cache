We show that when other nodes can generate randomness, even a single unicast uniform wiretap problem is as hard as the non-multicast network coding problem.

"},"body":{"text":"Recent advances in functional genomics have shown that genetic sequences, such as genes, RNA, proteins, and various regulatory elements represent parts of complicated large-scale networks. Properties of such networks can be inferred by measuring the concentration of various macromolecules within one or multiple cells in an organism. Determining these con- centrations is a non-trivial process which is largely facilitated by DNA microarrays (Gene Chips) [1]. DNA microarrays are two-dimensional arrays of short single-stranded DNA sequences corresponding to gene segments. Messenger RNA molecules extracted from a cell are ﬁrst converted into comple- mentary DNA (cDNA), tagged with ﬂuorescent markers and then distributed on a microarray substrate. Since Watson-Crick complementary DNA strands have a strong afﬁnity to bond (hybridize) with each other, cDNA strands attach themselves to spots containing their complementary sequences. Which\nsequences succeeded in hybridizing with their complements can be detected by illuminating the chip by laser light of a given wavelength and measuring the intensity of ﬂuorescence of the cDNA tags.\nDNA microarrays can exhibit high failure rates during manufacturing or subsequent operation. Errors in the read- out signal can be attributed to missed steps in the production process, substrate defects, optical detection system malfunc- tioning, background illumination and other phenomena. In or- der to ensure high data integrity, Affymetrix [1] introduced in its production process a sophisticated technology that utilizes designated quality control spots for detecting erroneously syn- thesized DNA strands [8]. Although these procedures ensure that DNA arrays are properly created, they provide no built- in error-control mechanism that allows an array to recover from subsequent loss of data in one or more spots in the grid. This motivated the authors of [11] to propose a DNA strand multiplexing scheme with redundant spots that ensures reliable operation of the array in the presence of multiple spot failures. The results in [11] were validated in terms of fabricating chips of small size. Since the tests were performed on arrays with six, eight and ten spots only, the problems of quality control and cost of the production process were not addressed within the given context.\nWe propose to investigate a class of problems in combi- natorics and error-control coding that arise in the process of fabricating DNA microarrays with multiplexed DNA strands. Many important results pertaining to the design of opti- mal masks, quality control spots and multiplexing schemes for error-correcting microarrays [6], [7], [8] have to be re- examined within this new setting. We address a class of such problems and describe future research directions in this area.\nSections II and III of the paper are mainly expository and structured in such a way that allows the interested reader to grasp both the technological and mathematical aspects under- lying DNA microarray production and operation. New ideas regarding joint error-control coding and production quality control are described in Section IV of the manuscript. Detailed studies of algorithmic aspects of the underlying design process, code construction methods, and various optimization strategies will be provided in the full version of the paper.\nThe process of DNA chip manufacturing pioneered by Affymetrix is based on photolitographic VLSIPS (Very Large Scale Immobilized Polymer Synthesis) methods which allow for simultaneous synthesis of multiple chips on one wafer. Each chip consists of a regular grid of spots at which a large number of short, customer selected single-stranded DNA sequences are placed. These DNA strands usually represent judiciously chosen subsequences of genes, or more precisely, DNA coding regions. Such strands have predeﬁned structures which can in many cases be modeled by certain random processes.\nThe microarray fabrication process starts with creating a two-dimensional wafer on which certain molecules, termed linkers, are placed in a regular grid of spots. Linkers are equipped with photolabile protective groups that render them inactive in the absence of external light stimuli. At each step of the production process, a mask that speciﬁes a subset of spots to be used during that production stage is designed. The mask is carefully imposed over the wafer and the system is il- luminated. In the presence of light, the protective groups of the linkers dissolve, allowing the linkers to become operational. After this activation step, a solution containing a large number of the same DNA base (which is either adenin (A), guanin (G), thymin (T ) or cytosin (C)) is dispensed on the wafer. This allows the nucleotides to bind to active linkers, creating the ﬁrst base of the DNA sequences to be synthesized on the chip. Such DNA sequences are known as DNA probes. Each of the added nucleotides also contains a photolabile protective group which does not allow for multiple bases to attach to the linkers or to each other. The process is repeated an appropriate number of times by choosing at each step a different mask and a different nucleotide solution to be added to the wafer.\nThe order of the bases used in the production process is referred to as the base schedule. Usually, the schedule represents s periodic repetitions of the four DNA bases, which is denoted by (AT GC) s . An example of a base schedule and masking process is shown in Figure 1. The masks for the ﬁve spots are represented by the columns of the array where a black rectangle corresponds to an exposed area while a white rectangle corresponds to a masked area. The DNA sequences generated at each of the ﬁve spots in the ﬁgure are AAT C, GGCG, T AAT , CT GA, and ACAA, respectively.\nThe design process based on the periodic schedule shown in Figure 1 is synchronous, since each spot can be exposed\nto light only once during a period of length four. One can also use an asynchronous schedule, in which one spot can be exposed to light multiple times within a period [9].\nThree important mathematical problems can be posed re- garding the choice of the base schedule, the mask structures and the possibility of detecting production failures in a DNA microarray.\nBase Scheduling: One problem of interest is to ﬁnd the shortest possible asynchronous schedule that can produce a complete set of predeﬁned probes. The shortest schedule ensures reductions in the cost of chip production and it also decreases the overall error-probability of probe formation. It is straightforward to see that such a schedule takes the form of a shortest common superstring of the probes, the computation of which is known to be NP-hard [9]. Furthermore, since the probes are usually selected in such a way that they poorly hybridize with each other, no large probe sequence overlaps are expected. Consequently, most currently available fabrication methods use periodic schedules.\nMask Design: Since spots are activated by illumination, it is possible that due to reﬂections, imprecisions in the optical system and the mask layout, spots neighboring the target spot become exposed to light as well. This unintended illumination can activate linkers of spots which were supposed to be masked, resulting in erroneous probe synthesis. One method to mitigate these effects is to minimize the total length of the borders of masks used in the VLSIPS process [6], [7]. The total border length of masks under a synchronous schedule corresponds to the sum of all pairwise Hamming distances d H between probes at adjacent spots (adjacency in this context means that spots share at least one edge). If the set of probes consists of all possible DNA sequences of length N , the minimum border-length is achieved in terms of using two-dimensional Gray code mask designs [6]. When the probes are structurally constrained, some of the best known mask design methods rely on constructing probe neighborhood graphs [7]. Neighborhood graphs are complete graphs with vertices corresponding to the probes; the weight of an edge bridging two vertices equals the Hamming distance between the probes corresponding to the vertices. For such a graph, an approximate solution for the travelling salesman (TS) problem is sought, which speciﬁes an ordering of the probes that is to be transferred to the array. This transfer is achieved in terms of threading, which is based on the use of certain space- ﬁlling curves that embed a one-dimensional string into a two- dimensional grid [7].\nQuality Control: As described in the Manufacturing Qual- ity Control and Validation Studies of GeneChip Arrays Manual in [1] the accuracy of the production steps is controlled in terms of a designated subset of quality control spots [8]. In this setting, m quality control spots contain c < m different probes, and identical probes are synthesized using different steps of the manufacturing process. By performing hybridization tests on quality control spots one can identify if a faulty step occurred during probe synthesis. The work in [2], [3], [12] extends this testing framework one step further,\nby proposing a coding scheme for identifying one erroneous production step. Information about erroneous production steps can be used to identify systematic problems in the production process.\nFrom the perspective of coding theory the quality control problem can be formulated by referring to the following combinatorial objects.\nDeﬁnition 2.1: [12] Let A be an M × N array of binary numbers such that the weight of each row equals r, the Hamming distance between any two columns is at least d, and the weight of each column is within the interval [ω min , ω max ], for d ≤ ω min < ω max ≤ M − d. Then A is called a balanced binary code with parameters (M, N, r, d, ω min , ω max ).\nA balanced binary code can be interpreted as an array of M quality control spots and N production steps. A \u201c1\u201d is placed at position (i, j) of the array if and only if the i- th quality control spot was active during the j-th step of the fabrication process. The constant row weight constraint is imposed in order to ensure that all quality control probes are of the same length, while the Hamming distance guarantees that two productions steps have distinguishable signatures even in the presence of d spot drop-outs. The restrictions on the weight of the columns guarantees that one can distinguish between a step failing and a step not being used in the production process, since one usually only measures relative rather than absolute ﬂuorescence intensities.\nThe problem of designing balanced codes is well under- stood. To construct arrays corresponding to balanced codes it sufﬁces to use combinatorial designs or subsets of codewords of codes with large minimum distance [2]. Far more inter- esting is the problem of detecting multiple production step failures. This question can be addressed in the framework of superimposed designs deﬁned below [5], [10], [12].\nDeﬁnition 2.2: [5] Let A be an M × N array of binary numbers with columns x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x N and rows of weight r. Such an array A is said to be a (M, N, r, s)-superimposed design with constraint r and strength s if all component-wise Boolean OR functions of not more than s columns of A are distinct.\nAssume that the quality control matrix of a microarray corresponds to a superimposed design with constraint r. Then each probe has length r and multiple production step failures can be detected as follows. First, note that in order for a probe to be erroneously synthesized, at least one production step during which the probe was active has to fail. Consequently, the hybridization intensity proﬁle of quality control probes contains information about the component-wise Boolean OR function of the columns of the control array. If each Boolean OR function of not more than s columns is unique, one can identify any set of not more than s failed production steps. It is important to observe that there is no guarantee that a quality control scheme based on a superimposed design can guarantee proper identiﬁcations of multiple production step failures in the presence of spot drop-outs in the control-array.\nUpon completion of the DNA microarray fabrication and testing process, the structure and properties of the array can change so that certain spots become nonfunctional. Spot failure is a common event which is very hard to detect since it manifests itself in terms of low ﬂuorescence intensity during a hybridization experiment. But low ﬂuorescence at a given spot can also be attributed to the gene corresponding to the syn- thesized probe being inactive in the tested cell. Consequently, there exists a strong need to design microarrays in such a way that even under spot failure, information about every single gene originally present in the grid is available. This can be achieved by multiplexing identical probes to different spots in the array. We provide next a sampling of ideas for strand multiplexing described in [11].\nIn what we will henceforth call a multiplexed array, every spot contains a mixture of a ﬁxed number of different probes, and the number of spots exceeds the number of tested probes. For an array with the aforementioned properties, one seeks to design a binary multiplexing matrix, G, of dimension M × N where M denotes the number of spots, N denotes the number of distinct probes and M > N . The matrix G has to have full rank and the property that G(i, j) = 1 if and only if the i th spot contains the j th probe. Under the assumption that all spots have identical properties, that the system noise is additive and i.i.d, and that all probes show identical hybridization afﬁnities with their complements, the optimal choice for G is the one that minimizes\nwhere G ∗ denotes the well known pseudo-inverse of G deﬁned as G ∗ = (G T G) −1 G T . An example of a multiplexing matrix with M = 6 and N = 4 was presented in [11] and is shown below.\n   \n0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\n  \nFor the above example, in the presence of any two spots failures the information about gene probes remains intact for any form of comparative study. Each spot contains two probes and each probe appears at three different spots. Note that the number of different probes placed at each spot should be small, and that the probes synthesized at the same spot should poorly hybridize with each other and their complementary DNA sequences.\nWe describe next a new VLSIPS process for constructing multiplexed arrays based on a combination of ideas outlined in the previous two sections. The goal is to modify the VLSIPS process in such a way that multiple sequences can be synthesized at each spot, and that production failure can be tested under similar conditions as outlined in the Affymetrix standard.\nM uniformly and independently chosen sequences of length N > 3 over the alphabet D = {A, T, G, C} are given. Let the sequences in the ﬁrst set describe the blue probes, and let the sequences in the second set describe the green probes. Let the length of the optimal asynchronous schedule for synthesizing the 2M sequences by using blue, green and cyan colors be S b,g,c (N, M ). Then\nFor most DNA microarrays probes have lengths not ex- ceeding 30. For these lengths, the reduction in the number of production steps offered by a system with simultaneous probe extension features may not justify the high computational cost for ﬁnding a near-optimal schedule. But for certain non-medical applications of DNA microarrays, such as DNA cryptography, the probes are much longer. In this case, the production cost of a multiplexed array with steps of three colors may be much smaller than the one of its counterpart involving two colors only.\nMask Selection: For multiplexed arrays one also requires a set of carefully designed masks that can minimize the probability of erroneous probe synthesis. For the case that the green and blue probes are synthesized using a disjoint set of synchronous steps, the problem of mask design can be formulated in a similar manner as described in [7] (see Figure 3 for an illustration of the problem; there, L(M ) denotes the border length of a mask). A major modiﬁcation in the procedure outlined in [7] is that each vertex Θ in the neighborhood graph corresponding to one spot is labeled by two sequences, specifying two differently colored probes p 1 (Θ) and p 2 (Θ). For two vertices in the neighborhood graph Θ 1 = {p 1 (Θ 1 ), p 2 (Θ 1 )} and Θ 2 = {p 1 (Θ 2 ), p 2 (Θ 2 )}, the weight δ(Θ 1 , Θ 2 ) of the edge connecting Θ 1 and Θ 2 equals d H (p 1 (Θ 1 ), p 1 (Θ 2 )) + d H (p 2 (Θ 1 ), p 2 (Θ 2 )). The sum of all distances δ(Θ 1 , Θ 2 ) between vertices in the neighborhood graph corresponding to adjacent spots provides a measure of the total border-length of masks used during the production process. Note that in a multiplexed array, the mask border- length minimization problem has to be solved under a probe placement constraints imposed by the multiplexing matrix G. Furthermore, the probes at the same spot have to be at sufﬁciently large Hamming distance from each other in order to prevent erroneous hybridization. This makes the problem of placing similar probes at neighboring sites in the array quite challenging and poses new and interesting questions regarding optimal threading strategies.\nThe solution to the problem of minimizing border-length of masks with production steps of three colors strongly de- pends on the chosen base and color schedule. Due to space limitations, it will not be addressed in this paper.\nQuality-Control: The process of testing a multiplexed array for faulty production steps can be partitioned into two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, complements of green probes (appropriately tagged with green ﬂuorescent tags) are applied to the wafer. At this stage, it is possible to infer if some of the steps using\ngreen or cyan light failed by designing quality control probe arrays based on superimposed codes. In the second stage of the testing process, the wafer is exposed to a solution of complementary sequences of blue probes. This stage allows for identifying erroneous blue steps in the production process, and it is facilitated by side-information provided from the previous stage. Notice that if no cyan steps are used, a quality control code appropriate for this setting reduces to an interleaved pair of superimposed codes. Otherwise, the quality control array should be constructed by using two superimposed codes that satisfy some simple joint constraints on the codewords specifying the cyan-colored production steps.\nBy referring to the results in [13] one can prove the following result regarding multiplexed arrays.\nTheorem 4.2: Assume that there exists a linear error-control code with parameters [n, k, d] containing the all-ones code- word. Then one can construct a quality control array for a multiplexed DNA chip with 2 · (2 k −2) disjoint blue and green production steps and n probes such that the length of each quality control probe is 2 k−1 − 1, and that the weights w of the columns in the quality control array satisfy d ≤ w ≤ n−d. Furthermore, with such an array any collection of less than n/(n − d) failed blue or green steps, respectively, can be uniquely identiﬁed.\nAn interesting open problem is how to extend the result of theorem 4.2 in order to achieve the unique identiﬁcation property in the presence of a given number of spot failures and involving cyan-colored production steps."},"refs":[{"authors":[],"title":{"text":""}},{"authors":[{"name":"N.
