An A/D converter is illustrated in Figure 1. If the input signal is bandlimited, and   is smaller than the Nyquist sampling interval,  £¢ , then the signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples. On the other hand, the amplitude discretization introduces an irreversible loss of information. Precise mathematical characterization of this loss of information, i.e. the accuracy of A/D conversion, remained evasive for many decades. To cite R. M. Gray, \u201c Deceptively\nTraditionally, quantization error is modelled as an iid pro- cess, uniformly distributed in the ¤¦¥§¡©¨¡©¨©© range [2]. This approach leads to the following result about the mean square error between an input bandlimited signal  and a signal \nreconstructed from quantized samples of  by means of linear ﬁltering: \t \nThe conclusion drawn from this formula is that by means of oversampling the accuracy of A/D conversion can be increased beyond the limits imposed by the precision of the quantizer. From the rate distortion perspective, it was traditionally be- lieved that this approach to attaining high conversion accuracy was suboptimal since the bit-rate\nincreases linearly with the oversampling ratio\n, leading to a rate distortion characteristics of the form\nwhereas, if the accuracy is increased by reﬁning quantization, the error decays exponentially in the bit-rate.\nStill, due to the costs involved in the production of high- resolution quantizers, high accuracy of modern techniques for A/D conversion is achieved through oversampling.\nHowever, even an elementary deterministic analysis reveals that the statistical approach is very misleading about the actual accuracy of oversampled A/D conversion. In particular, the error between  and its reconstructed version   , obtained at some ﬁnite   by means of IPRQTS 1 interpolation (ideal low-pass ﬁltering) is given by\nis the quantized version of '¤(f    . When   tends to zero, the error signal converges toward\nwhich is not the zero function. The discrepancy between the expression in (1) and this observations about the asymptotic er- ror behaviour is due to the fact that the statistical model is not valid for high oversampling ratios when correlations between quantization errors are more pronounced. And contrary to what could be expected from this negative result about the accuracy of oversampled A/D conversion, many classes of signals can actually be reconstructed with a higher accuracy than predicted by (1), but that requires more sophisticated methods than linear ﬁltering.\nIn this paper, we review some relatively recent results of deterministic analysis of oversampled A/D conversion [4], [3], which established some surprising facts about its actual accuracy and rate-distortion characteristics and lead to a con- struction of a single-bit oversampled A/D conversion scheme which attains an\nerror behaviour and exponential rate- distortion characteristics [5], [6].\nConsider oversampled A/D conversion of signals in the space of  -bandlimited functions in \n. We shall denote this space by  . Let ! \"# be at the input of an A/D converter with a sampling interval   and a quantization step\n, as shown in Figure 1. The question which we are trying to answer is: how accurately  can be reconstructed from the sequence of its quantized samples\n. To this end, consider a signal\n, that is a signal which at the output of the A/D converter produces the same sequence of quantized samples as  . Since\n, if  has a quantization threshold crossing at some time instant \"§119\n, then 0  must cross the same quantization threshold at some instant \" 1A@\nwhich lies in the same sampling interval with 9\n, and vice versa, as illustrated in Figure 2. This implies that the difference between\n(see Figure 2). As  SR \t T , for any consistent estimate 0\nis progressively smaller, and in the limit when   1 T , 0 '¤E9\nat every quantization threshold crossing 9\nof  . Does this imply that in the limit 0  ¤#\"$ 1 '¤(\"$ U3H\"V W 6 , and that any sequence of consistent estimates converges in \nsense to  as  XRHT ? The answer depends on the sampling properties of the sequence of quantization threshold crossings ¤D9\nin # . There are three possible scenarios.\nis not a sequence of uniqueness [7] in   . In this case, even in the limit,   1 T , when 0 '¤D9\n, there is no guarantee that they would be close at other time instants.\nthe stable sampling condition is satisﬁed, any sequence of consistent estimates converges in \nsense to  at a rate established by the following theorem [3].\nTheorem 2.1: Let the sequence of quantization threshold crossings ¤D9\nof a signal  in   , be a uniformly discrete sequence of stable sampling in   . There exists a dfe T such that for all   Ggd , any consistent estimate 0  of  satisﬁes\nbut does not depend on   or 0  .\nHence, there exist signals for which the accuracy of over- sampled A/D conversion cannot be improved by increasing the oversampling ratio, and there are also signals for which the error converges to zero as  pR , and if that is the case the error decays proportionally to  \nrather than   . While some intuition about these two classes of signals was given in [3], which demonstrated that both classes comprise signiﬁcant sets of bandlimited signals, their precise characterization is very intricate.\nThe stronger error bound of Theorem 2.1 has quite ap- pealing practical implications, however the constant ACi in (6) depends on a particular signal, hence the  \naccuracy is not uniform on sufﬁciently general sets of bandlimited signals. Another important issue is ﬁnding practical reconstruction algorithms which attain the accuracy asserted by Theorem 2.1.\nThe reconstruction can be approached as the problem of interpolation of a bandlimited signal from an irregular se- quence of samples ¤e'¤D9\nis known with some ﬁnite precision,   ¨ , whereas '¤E9\n\u2019s are known with inﬁnite precision since they are equal to corresponding quan- tization threshold. For good numerical properties of practical algorithms for reconstruction of  from this information, the density of ¤D9H\nneeds to be greater than 3 [5] (above the Nyquist rate), however, it turns out that the density of quantization threshold crossings of a signal in   cannot be greater than 3 [3].\nLet us now reconsider the bit-rate of oversampled A/D conversion. Observe that the sequence of quantized samples\nof  is completely speciﬁed by the corre- sponding sequence of quantization threshold crossings [4]. To encode the sequence of quantization threshold crossings, we ﬁrst partition the time axis into consecutive segments of length\n. Then we represent the r -th quantization threshold crossing on a given segment q as ¤Dsut wvxtx , where sut is the position of the sampling interval in which the crossing occurs within q , and v t is the level of the corresponding threshold. Since the bit-rate needed for encoding levels v\ndoes not depend on   , and the bit-rate needed to encode indices s\n, the overall bit-rate of this encoding scheme is\n[4]. Finally, if the error converges to zero as established by Theorem 2.1, with this encoding scheme the rate-distortion characteristics of oversampled A/D conversion becomes\nwhere AdC¥  i and ¦ i are constants which depend on  but do not depend on   . Similarly, even with the linear reconstruction, for moderate oversampling ratios for which the statistical model of the quantization error is valid, it follows from (1) that the rate-distortion characteristics of oversampled A/D conversion with the quantization threshold crossings encoding is\nThe considerations in this section reveal both the poten- tial of oversampled A/D conversion to achieve a superior accuracy and rate distortion characteristics than suggested by the traditional point of view, as well as its limitations and problems that need to be solved in order to guarantee a uniform \u0087\u0088¤  \nerror behaviour and exponential rate distortion characteristics on broad classes of bandlimited signals. These lead to the construction of a single-bit A/D conversion scheme [5], described in the following sections, which resolves all the problems involved by introducing a deterministic dither function.\nthat is, the set of  -bandlimited signals with ﬁnite energy and amplitude bounded by 3 .\nThe single-bit dithered A/D converter is deﬁned by means of a dither function\n. We shall assume that the dither function satisﬁes conditions which ensure that the composite signal  \u0084 \u0085 changes sign on every interval\n, for every  in ¨ . In particular, we shall require that \u0085 is a \u0083 C -function that for all\n, therefore alternates in sign, hence, there must be at least one zero-crossing of  \u0084 \u0085 in every interval\nwhich is sufﬁciently dense to form a sequence of stable sampling in   . This motivates the following deﬁnition [5].\nThe output of the converter is a sequence of indices of sampling intervals where zero-crossings of X\u0084 \u0085 occur; one zero-crossing within each interval \n. For simplicity, in the deﬁnition of the converter we choose this to be the ﬁrst zero- crossing in \n, but any other selection algorithm would work as well.\nThe bit-stream produced in this conversion allows for point- wise reconstruction of any signal in ¨ with \u0087\u0088¤    accuracy, uniformly in time and on ¨ , as asserted by the following theorem [5].\nThe bit-rate, 6 , of this conversion scheme is determined by the number of sampling intervals within each interval \nwill be kept ﬁxed, and   will typically be signiﬁcantly smaller than 3\n. Thus the bit-rate needed for specifying the location of one data change within \nwith precision   satisﬁes\nThis result on the bit-rate along with the result of Theorem 3.2 then imply that there exist a positive constants A9C such that for any conversion consistent estimate 0  of \nLet us now focus on explicit local-reconstruction algorithms that attain the accuracy asserted by Theorem 3.2. Observe that for every interval \ngives us the value of a time instant \u0083\nmust be zero for some \"a &¤e\u0083\nfor all \" ( this follows from     , see [10]) and   \u0085\nthus speciﬁes the sampling se- quence ¤#\"\nand, within an error proportional to   , the values of  at these sampling points.

Therefore, ¤(\"\nconstitutes a sequence of stable sampling for all the spaces @w  for all DxQy [7], [9], and thus for\nin a numerically stable manner. In our case, these samples are, however, known only at a ﬁnite precision. The following theorem asserts that there exist \u0083\n(where \u0083 ¢ are constants that do not depend on  ), which can be linearly combined to reconstruct  from its quantized samples with \u0087\u0088¤    accuracy [5].\nis that it guarantees local reconstruction with a small accuracy degradation. In particular, consider reconstructing  at some\nwhere constants # ,  and \u0083 ¢ are as deﬁned in the above. This bound does not depend on U and is uniform in  on ¨ .\naccuracy of the proposed single-bit A/D conversion scheme. In this section we consider a practical reconstruction algorithm which comes very close to the\naccuracy. The approach we take is to interpolate between the quantized samples\n, and then synthesize  using an appropriate function  of fast decay as\nFor that purpose one can use any function  such that its Fourier transform \"  is \u0083\nfor all f , then the resulting sum approximates  within an error proportional to a , uniformly in \" :\n(20) Consider now estimating samples ¤\u0084'¤#f ¨ \nfrom quan- tized samples ¤\u0084'¤#\"\nusing Lagrangian interpolation. Without loss of generality, we focus on interpolating  at\n.

We therefore also need to estimate the error between §¦¤¨¨  and 0 ¦©¨¨  , which is the Lagrange interpolation between the approximate values of '¤#\"\n. The explicit form of the Lagrange interpolation formula allows us to bound this as [5]\nand ¢ 1  . We select the interpolation order  so that the interpolation error is kept below the quantization error; in particular,  \n. It follows that for\nIf  is now synthesized from interpolated samples according to (19), the error bound is provided by (20), with a 1\n. The error of local reconstruction, when  is synthesized using ﬁnitely many expansion terms around a point of interest, exhibits the same fast decay in the number of expansion terms as the truncation error given in (18).\nObserve that for Lagrangian interpolation to be effective, in the sense that the interpolation error can be reduced to a level below the quantization error one needs  e  ¨ . Lagrangian interpolation also causes accumulation of the quantization error according to a power law in the interpolation order that ultimately causes degradation of the overall conversion accu- racy by a factor \u0087\u0088¤  r\u0080y\u0082\u0081     ¡  .

Positions of zero crossings of '¤(\"$#\u0084 # S yIuY\" are in our A/D conversion scheme known only at a ﬁnite precision, hence we reconstruct\n. The error made by this approximation can be shown to be bounded as [6]\n, which would make the error of local reconstruction decay\nexponentially in the length of the interpolation interval.
