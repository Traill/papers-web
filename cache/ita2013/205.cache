This extends conventional routing, which allows a node to only forward its received data. This concept was ﬁrst introduced by Ahlswede et al. [1] in the context of multicasting data in a network of lossless links.\nNetwork coding is particularly useful in a broadcast medium. For example, consider three wireless nodes v 0 , v 1 , v 2 illustrated in Figure 1, where nodes v 1 and v 2 are both within the communication range of node v 0 . Suppose node v 1 has packet x 1 , node v 2 has packet x 2 , and node v 0 has packets x 1 and x 2 . Suppose further that node v 1 needs packet x 2 and node v 2 needs packet x 1 . A single transmission of a packet x 1 + x 2 (where \u2018+\u2019 stands for the bit-wise XOR of the two packets) by node v 0 achieves two purposes: It allows node v 1 to recover x 2 and node v 2 to recover x 1 . This technique was termed physical piggybacking by Wu et al. [2] because the two packets are combined into one, without even increasing the size of the packet.\nWu et al. [2] demonstrated that packet exchanges can naturally beneﬁt from physical piggybacking. More recently, Katti et al. [3] presented a framework for taking advantage of physical piggybacking to improve the efﬁciency of unicasting in multi-hop wireless networks. In their framework, each node snoops on the medium and buffers packets it heard. A node\nalso informs its neighbors which packets they overheard. This allows nodes to know (roughly) what packets are available at each neighbor and then perform mixing to efﬁciently use the channel.\nIn such a system, a critical issue is how to optimize the formation of mixture packets so as to most efﬁciently use the channel resource. Figure 2 gives one example problem sce- nario. The table lists the trafﬁc demand. For this example, one possible solution is to broadcast x 1 + x 3 + x 4 to {v 1 , v 2 , v 3 } and x 2 + x 5 to {v 3 , v 4 }.\nIn this paper we formulate a mathematical abstraction of such an issue, which is called the local mixing problem. There is a source node v 0 , who has a set of neighbors V . The source node v 0 has M mutually independent sources, x 1 , . . . , x M . The rate of source x m is r m . Each source x m is initially available at a set of neighbors H m ⊆ V and is needed by a set of neighbors W m ⊆ V . Hence the trafﬁc demand can be characterized by M tuples { H m , W m , r m } M m =1 .\nThe trafﬁc demand needs to be fulﬁlled by the channel resources. We abstract out the channel coding issue and focus on the mixing (network coding) issue. This amounts to a separate treatment of channel coding and network coding, where the channel coding is concerned about converting the noisy channel into near-lossless bits and the network coding is concerned about using the lossless bits to fulﬁll the trafﬁc demand. Although this separation approach could be subop- timal than a joint channel and network coding approach, the separation approach is closer to engineering practice and it allows us to focus on mixing without referring to channel properties. Speciﬁcally, the physical layer is abstracted by a capacity region C consisting of channel rate vectors c of length 2 |V | − 1. In the case there are three neighbors, v 1 , v 2 , v 3 , each channel rate vector is of the form\nmeaning that the channel can simultaneously provide rate c {1} to v 1 , rate c {1,2} to {v 1 , v 2 }, etc. In other words, we are\nmodelling the physical layer as 2 |V | − 1 lossless channels indexed by the set of receivers; the channel for a subset Q ⊆ V can transfer information reliably from v 0 to Q at rate c Q .\nTherefore, the problem is to characterize the admissible rate region, i.e., the set of channel rate allocations c that can fulﬁll the trafﬁc demand { H m , W m , r m } M m =1 .\nThe main result of this paper is that under the constraint that each neighbor decodes only from received symbols that are functions of sources that the node can eventually recover, the admissible rate region can be characterized by a set of linear constraints and linear mixing is optimal.\nConsider trafﬁc demand { H m , W m , r m } M m =1 . For the rest of the paper, we use a different representation of the trafﬁc demand. We can classify the sources into several types: A source characterized by H m , W m , r m is said to be of type\nH m , W m . Let Φ denote the set of all possible source types. For example, if there are two neighbors V = {v 1 , v 2 }, then\nWe represent the original trafﬁc demand { H m , W m , r m } M m =1 as a length- |Φ| vector r, whose entry r φ is the sum rate of sources of type φ ∈ Φ. We then treat as if there are |Φ| sources, with rate speciﬁed by r.\nAny solution for the problem sends out a sequence of output symbols on the broadcast channels. Each output symbol is a function of some of the sources {x φ }.\nEach neighbor v ∈ V receives a subset of the output symbols and needs to recover its needed sources using the received output symbols, and the source symbols that it initially has. For each neighbor v, denote the set of sources that v has or wants by\nHere we write φ = φ H , φ W as a convention. Sources outside x v are said to be \u201cpollution sources\u201d for v. If a pollution source is involved in generating an output symbol Y , then we say Y is a \u201cpolluted\u201d symbol from v\u2019s point of view. In this section we impose the following constraint and look for optimal solutions under this constraint.\nConstraint 1 (\u201cDecoding from Unpolluted Data Only\u201d): Each node v ∈ V decodes its needed information using only\nthe sources it initially has, and its received output symbols that are functions of sources in x v . In other words, each node is required to ignore any polluted symbols that it receives.\nAssuming pollution-free decoding (i.e., under Constraint 1), the trafﬁc demand r can be fulﬁlled by channel rate vector c\nHere variable f (v) φP exists only for {v} ⊆ P ⊆ φ H ∪ φ W ⊆ V ; variable σ P Q exists only for ∅ ⊂ P ⊆ Q ⊆ V .\nFurthermore, if the above linear system of constraints has a feasible solution, then the trafﬁc demand r can be fulﬁlled by c via linear coding.\nWe now explain the linear constraints in Theorem 1. We introduce a directed graph Z, as illustrated by Fig. 3. There are three layers of vertices. The nodes in layer 1, {in φ : φ ∈ Φ}, model the |Φ| sources; the node in φ has an associated (source) trafﬁc r φ . The nodes in layer 2, {out P : ∅ ⊂ P ⊆ V }, model the 2 |V | − 1 \u201coutput buffers\u201d that hold output symbols (their meaning will be explained shortly); the buffer out P has an associated rate g P , representing the total rate of its output symbols. The nodes in layer 3, {ch Q : ∅ ⊂ Q ⊆ V }, model the 2 |V | − 1 physical channels; the channel ch Q has an associated capacity c Q .\nA source node in φ has an outgoing edge to an output buffer out P if φ H ∪ φ W ⊇ P ; such an edge is denoted by φP . An output buffer out P has an outgoing edge to channel ch Q if P ⊆ Q; such an edge is denoted by P Q. We use the name \u201cstage 1\u201d (resp. \u201cstage 2\u201d) to refer to the subgraph of Z induced by layer-1 and layer-2 nodes (resp. layer-2 and layer-3 nodes).\nIn Theorem 1, Constraints (3)-(5) correspond to an trafﬁc assignment in stage 1 for each neighbor v, where the sources that v wants are assigned to the output buffers {out P } that v receives. Constraints (6)-(8) correspond to an trafﬁc assign- ment in stage 2, where the trafﬁc held by buffers {out P } are assigned to the channels {ch Q }.\nTheorem 1 can now be alternatively stated as follows. Assuming pollution-free decoding, trafﬁc demand r can be fulﬁlled by channel resource c if and only if there exists a valid trafﬁc assignment {f (v) φP } in stage 1 for each individual neighbor v and a common valid trafﬁc assignment {σ P Q } in stage 2 for all neighbors.\nAny solution S corresponds to an assignment of output symbols to the 2 |V | − 1 channels, such that the total rate in each channel Q does not exceed the channel capacity c Q .\nConsider assigning each output symbol into one of (2 |V | −1) output buffers {out P : ∅ ⊂ P ⊆ V } as follows. For each output symbol Y , we put it into buffer out P , where P is the set of neighbors that uses Y for decoding. After such a classiﬁcation process, let g P denote the sum rate of output symbols in buffer out P ; collectively, let g be the length- (2 |V | − 1) vector obtained by concatenating {g P } together. Note that if a symbol is transmitted by channel ch Q and used by P for decoding, then P ⊆ Q. Let σ P Q be the sum rate of symbols that are transmitted by channel ch Q and used by P for decoding. Then (6)-(8) must be satisﬁed.\nNow consider an arbitrary neighbor v. It has access to the symbols in buffers {out P : P ∋ v}, and the sources {x φ \u2032 : φ H ∋ v}. It needs to recover sources {x φ : φ W ∋ v}. Due to Constraint 1, each symbol in out P can only be a function of {x φ : φ H ∪ φ W ⊇ P }.\nThe coding for node v can be viewed as a single source network coding problem in a network, illustrated by Fig. 4. In Z, add a virtual source node s v that has an outgoing edge with capacity r φ to each source x φ that v wants. In addition, add a virtual destination node t v that has an incoming edge with inﬁnite capacity from each source x φ \u2032 that v has, and an incoming edge with capacity g P from each output buffer out P with P ∋ v. Denote the resulting graph by Z v . Then any solution S for the original local mixing problem maps into a solution in Z v for the problem of transferring the sources x v from s v to t v . From [1], there must exist an s v \u2013t v ﬂow in Z v that provides rate φ :φ H ∪φ W ∋v r φ . Such ﬂow condition is equivalent to the constraints (3)-(5).\nWe ﬁrst explain the basic idea underlying the proof. We associate a tag with each output symbol; the value of the tag is a subset of V , which indicates the set of neighbors \u201cinterested\u201d in this symbol. If a symbol Y is tagged with U ⊆ V , then Y must not be pollution to any neighbor in U ; i.e.,\nWe maintain 2 |V | −1 tagged buffers {out P : ∅ ⊂ P ⊆ V }; the buffer out P holds output symbols tagged with P . The output symbols in out P are generated by mixing the compatible sources {x φ : φ H ∪ φ W ⊇ P }; this is modelled by the connection structure in stage 1 of Z.\nProof of Sufﬁciency: Consider an arbitrary feasible so- lution, {f (v) φP , g P , σ P Q }, that satisﬁes the linear system of constraints (3)-(8). Without essential loss of generality, we assume all the variables and constants in (3)-(8) are integer.\nIn Z, replace each edge φP in stage 1 by r φ parallel unit- capacity edges from in φ to out P , and each edge P Q in stage 2 by σ P Q parallel unit-capacity edges, {P Q i : i = 1, . . . , σ P Q }, from out P to ch Q . Denote the resulting graph by Z. We next show that there exists a linear network coding assignment in Z that enables all neighbors to recover its needed information. Such a linear network coding assignment corresponds to a feasible solution that fulﬁlls the trafﬁc demand using channel resource c. The proof is based on the algebraic framework introduced by Koetter and Medard [4].\nLet F denote the operating ﬁnite ﬁeld. Each unit-capacity edge in Z can carry one symbol from F. The r φ parallel edges from in φ to out P carry the r φ source symbols, x φ 1 , . . . , x φr φ , respectively. Let y P denote the vector (of length g P ) formed by the set of all output symbols generated by buffer out P . Then in a linear coding assignment, y P is a linear transfor- mation of the sources observed by buffer out P :\nThe elements in w φP are said to be \u201cmixing coefﬁcients\u201d. Let w be a vector that includes every w φP for φP ∈ E(Z). Hence a linear network coding assignment is speciﬁed by an assignment of w, from F |w| (here |a| denotes the length of vector a).\nConsider an arbitrary neighbor v. We treat x v deﬁned in (2) as a vector formed by concatenating the sources that v has or wants. It has access to all the channels {ch Q : Q ∋ v}. Since all symbols generated by out P are assigned to channels {ch Q : P ⊆ Q} in stage 2, v has access to the output symbols {y P : P ∋ v}. In addition, v has access to the source symbols {x φ : φ H ∋ v}. Let y v be a vector formed by {y P : P ∋ v} and {x φ : φ H ∋ v}. For each P ∋ v, note that y P is a function of only x v , due to the connection structure of Z. Thus y v is\nwhere each element of Q v is either a binary constant or a mixture coefﬁcient in w.\nThe needed source information x v can be decoded from y v if and only if Q v has full column rank, which holds if and only if there exists a matrix P v of size |x v | × |y v | such that det(P v Q v ) = 0. Note that {f (v) φP } is a valid assignment of the sources trafﬁc {r φ : φ W ∋ v} to the buffers {out P : P ∋ v }. Thus, there exists an assignment of w and P v , with each element being either 0 or 1, such that det(P v Q v ) = 0.\nNow we consider the recoverability of all destination nodes. There exists a linear coding solution such that each destination can recover its needed information if and only if there exists an assignment of w and {P v : v ∈ V } that satisﬁes\nFollowing [4], the quantity v ∈V det(P v Q v ) can be viewed in two ways: (i) as a polynomial in terms of the variables w and {P v : v ∈ V } with coefﬁcients in F, (ii) as a number in F for given w and {P v : v ∈ V }. Earlier we have established that for each destination v alone, there exists an assignment of the elements in w and P v from F = GF (2) such that det(P v Q v ) = 0. This implies that for each destination v, det(P v Q v ) is a nonzero polynomial. Therefore, v ∈V det(P v Q v ) is a nonzero polynomial in terms of the variables w and {P v : v ∈ V } with coefﬁcients in F. It is known that for a non-zero polynomial deﬁned over a sufﬁciently large ﬁnite ﬁeld F, it must evaluate to a nonzero value at a certain point. This establishes the existence of w and {P v : v ∈ V } such that all needed symbols are recovered simultaneously at all destinations.\nIn the above we have shown the existence of a linear coding solution for a sufﬁciently large ﬁeld F. In fact, if we choose each mixing coefﬁcient in w and each element of {P v : v ∈ V } uniformly and independently from F, then the probability that all needed symbols are recovered approaches 1 as the ﬁeld size |F| approaches inﬁnity; this can be established via the Schwartz-Zippel Theorem (e.g., [5], according to [6]).\nIn this section we show it is possible to characterize the optimal mixing under Constraint 2, which is a relaxed version of Constraint 1.\nIf node v uses an output symbol Y that is a function of a subset of source symbols X , for decoding, then node v must recover all source symbols in X .\nConstraint 2 relaxes Constraint 1 by allowing a node v to treat some unwanted source symbols as wanted symbols. Equivalently, some source symbols now have more recipients. This results in more symbols to be recovered; the beneﬁt is\nthat some polluted symbols under Constraint 1 now become symbols that can be used by v for decoding.\nThe degree of freedom in adding recipients can be modelled by an additional assignment stage, as illustrated by Fig. 5 for the case V = {v 1 , v 2 }. We can treat a part of the original source x θ as source symbols of a source x \u2032 φ with θ H = φ H and θ W ⊆ φ W . Let τ θφ denote the amount of trafﬁc which is originally of type θ and converted to type φ. Then (13)- (15) hold. After such an assignment stage, the original trafﬁc demand r is now converted into a trafﬁc demand r \u2032 . Therefore, we have the following extension of Theorem 2.\nUnder Constraint 2, the trafﬁc demand r can be ful- ﬁlled by channel rate vector c if and only if there exists {τ θφ , r \u2032 φ , f (v) φP , g P , σ P Q } that satisfy\nHere variable τ θφ exists only for θ, φ ∈ Φ : θ H = φ H , θ W ⊆ φ W ; variable f (v) φP exists only for {v} ⊆ P ⊆ φ H ∪ φ W ⊆ V ; variable σ P Q exists only for ∅ ⊂ P ⊆ Q ⊆ V .\nFurthermore, if the above linear system of constraints has a feasible solution, then the trafﬁc demand r can be fulﬁlled by c via linear coding.\nThe local mixing problem can be viewed as a special case of the general multi-source multicasting problem (see, e.g., [7]). In the multi-source multicasting problem, there are a set of independent sources; each source is to be multicast through a network of lossless channels to a set of destination nodes.\nWe now show how to interpret the local mixing problem as a multi-source multicasting problem. We introduce a graph consisting of four layers of nodes, as illustrated by Figure 6. The ﬁrst layer consists of one node for each source type φ ∈ Φ. The second layer consists of a single node v 0 . The third layer consists of one node for each nonempty subset of V . The fourth layer consists of one node for each neighbor in V . There is an edge with inﬁnite capacity from every source X φ to v 0 , representing that v 0 has access to all these sources. Each source X φ has edges with inﬁnite capacity pointing to neighbors that have the source. The use of the channel for broadcasting to a set Q ⊆ V is represented by a tree-like structure: There is an edge with capacity c Q from v 0 to the node Q in the third layer and there is an edge with inﬁnite capacity from Q to each neighbor in Q.\nTherefore the local mixing problem is a special case of the multi-source multicasting problem. As a result, known theoretical results about the multi-source multicasting problem can be applied. In particular, the bounding techniques by Song et al. [8] (see also Chapter 15 of [7]) can be applied. We now explain the results.\nIntroduce random variables {X φ : φ ∈ Φ} and {Y Q : ∅ ⊂ Q ⊆ V }. Let N denote the union of these two sets. Let n ∆ = |N | = |Φ| + 2 |V | − 1. Let H n denote the (2 n − 1)-dimensional Euclidean space with the coordinates labelled by {h A : ∅ ⊂ A ⊆ N }. A column vector h ∈ H n is called entropic if for a certain joint distribution of random variables in N , h A is equal to the joint entropy of the random variables A, for every coordinate A ⊆ N . Then, the set of all entropic vectors is called the entropy space Γ ∗ n of n random variables:\nSpecifying the inner bound of [8] and after some manipu- lations, we see that c can fulﬁll trafﬁc demand r if there exist h ∈ Γ ∗ n that satisﬁes the following conditions:\nThese inequalities can be interpreted as follows. Here (23) says that the sources are mutually independent; (24) says that the output symbols has to be a function of the inputs; (25) says that each node must be able to recover all its wanted sources;\n(26) says that the entropy of the output Y Q must be strictly less than the total available channel bit-rate; (27) says that the entropy of X φ must be strictly less than the information rate of source φ.\nThe outer bound of [8] is applicable. Furthermore, following the derivations of [8] (or Chapter 15 of [7]), an outer bound customized for the current context can be obtained. The result is that if c can fulﬁll trafﬁc demand r, then there exists h ∈ Γ ∗ n that satisﬁes the linear constraints obtained by replacing \u2018>\u2019 in (26)(27) by \u2018 ≥\u2019. Moreover, a relaxed bound can be obtained by replacing Γ ∗ n by its outer bound Γ n , which is the set of nonnegative vectors h ∈ H n that satisﬁes all Shannon-type inequalities; see Chapter 15 of [7] for details.\nWe introduced the local mixing problem and presented constructive results. Theorem 1 states that if a system of linear constraints has a feasible solution, then the trafﬁc demand can be fulﬁlled by the given channel resource via (random) linear coding. This result is established via two key constructive techniques: (i) organizing data into different categories based on the interested neighbors, (ii) systematically exploring the degree of freedom in adding recipients. The local mixing problem is a special case of the multi-source multicasting problem: It does not involve multi-hop relaying. The techniques in this paper have been extended to the general multi-source multicasting problem in [9]."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R. Ahlswede"},{"name":"N. Cai"},{"name":"S.-Y. R.
