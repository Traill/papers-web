We propose a differential feedback method that significantly reduces this overhead by using a simple lossless, variable-length compression technique that exploits the slowly time-varying wireless channel."},"body":{"text":"Separate coding systems of correlated information sources are a form of communication system which is signiﬁcant from both theoretical and practical point of view in multi- user source networks. The ﬁrst fundamental theory in those coding systems was established by Slepian and Wolf [1]. They considered a separate source coding system of two correlated information sources. Those two sources are separately encoded and sent to a single destination, where the decoder reconstruct the original sources. In this system, Slepian and Wolf [1] determined the admissible rate region, the set that consists of a pair of transmission rates for which two sources can be decoded with an arbitrary small error probability.\nIn the above separate coding systems we can consider the case where the source outputs should be reconstructed with average distortions smaller than prescribed levels. Such a situation suggests the multiterminal rate distortion theory. The rate distortion theory for the separate coding system formulated by Slepian and Wolf has been studied by Wyner and Ziv [2], Wyner[3], Berger [4], Tung [5], Berger et. al [6], Kaspi and Berger [7], Berger and Yeung [8], and Oohama [9]. This problem, in general, remains an open problem and characterization of the rate distortion region has been unknown yet except for special cases.\nAs a practical situation of separate coding systems, we can consider the case where the separate encoders can not directly access the source outputs but can obtain their noisy observations. This situation was ﬁrst studied by Yamamoto and Ito [10]. They call the investigated coding system the communication system with a remote source. Subsequently, the separate source system with a remote observation or with\na incomplete source output was studied by Yamamoto [12] and Flynn and R. M. Gray [11].\nOohama [17] considered the separate source coding problem of Ä correlated Gaussian observations \t ½ ¾ ¡ ¡ ¡ Ä . We deal with the case that satisfy \t · Æ \t ½ ¾ ¡ ¡ ¡ Ä , where \t ½ ¾ ¡ ¡ ¡ Ä is a correlated Gaussian random vector and Æ \t ½ ¾ ¡ ¡ ¡ Ä are independent additive Ä Gaussian noises also independent of \t ½ ¾ ¡ ¡ ¡ Ä . In the above setup \t ½ ¾ ¡ ¡ ¡ Ä can be regarded as correlated Gaussian remote sources of \t ½ ¾ ¡ ¡ ¡ Ä , respectively. This coding system can also be considered as a vector version of the Gaussian CEO problem [13], [14], where\nare identical. In this separate source coding system Oohama [17] derived explicit outer and inner bounds of the rate distortion region. The above coding problem was ﬁrst posed and studied by Pandya et al. [15], and subsequently, Zhang and Wicker [16] investigated this problem. They derived inner and outer bounds of the rate distortion region. The results of Oohama [17] are sharper than theirs. In this paper, we show that the above inner and outer region coincides with each other when Gaussian correlated sources satisfy some condition.\nIn this section we state the problem formulation. Throughout this paper all logarithms are taken to the base natural. Let\nbe correlated zero mean Gaussian random variables taking values in real lines .
