An early major result of the ﬁeld was by Kumar and Gupta [9] where a network of n nodes was studied. Strengths of the connections between two nodes were determined entirely by the distance between them and followed a deterministic power scaling law. With this model, it was shown that a throughput that scaled like √n was the best possible. This implied that the throughput per user fell like 1 √ n which was a rather discouraging result. Except when nodes were allowed to approach each other [5], similar scaling laws were shown to hold [1], [8], [4], [7], [12], [10] for similar random and deterministic models.\nFrom the study of multi-antenna links [3], [11], it is now generally believed that a rich scattering environment, once thought to be detrimental to wireless communications, may actually be beneﬁcial. We show that a similar effect may hold for the expected aggregate data trafﬁc in a wireless network.\nRandom models may be preferred over distance-based ones since decay laws of the form 1/r α are usually valid in far- ﬁeld approximations and may not hold for networks of small physical size that are designed with minimum and maximum distances in mind. Additionally, automatic gain control can mitigate many distance effects. Thus, important signal-strength effects are often due to random ﬂuctuations in the medium. For example, [6], [17] start out with very different models\nand show that in the presence of obstructions and unreliable channels, the probability of good links between nodes that are far apart increases. Therefore we propose a model in which channel connections are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to some probability distribution function (pdf). This was ﬁrst proposed in [14], [15].\nWhile the throughput that is possible with this model depends very strongly on the distribution that the channel strengths are drawn from, several distributions, including the Bernoulli and some heavy-tailed distributions led to through- puts that were almost linear in n. Thus the introduction of randomness changes the behavior of the system signiﬁcantly.\nIn practice, we expect neither the deterministic model of [9] nor the random model of [15] to hold. A combination of distance-dependent connections and random connections would perhaps make for a better model. Therefore we also propose and analyze such a model. In the two-scale model we assume that nodes are randomly and uniformly distributed on a sphere of radius R. At the local scale, nodes that are within a distance r from each other are connected by channels that are distance-independent. These channel strengths are assumed to be drawn i.i.d. from a distribution, f(·). At a global scale, for nodes that are further apart than r, the channel connections obey a Rayleigh distribution with a mean power that depends on the distance between them and follows a distance-decay law, say g(·). Such a model incorporates the far ﬁeld effects at a global level through the decay law, but also recognizes that obstuc- tions play a role at a local scale. Furthermore, appropriate choices of r and R can help model a full spectrum of networks, from the purely geometric ones of [9] to the purely random ones of [15]. Not surprisingly, a combination of the techniques found in [9] and [15] are employed to study this model.\nConsider a network with n nodes labeled 1, . . . , n. Every pair of nodes {i, j} (i = j) is connected by a channel, denoted by the random variable h\n. We assume that the channel strengths, γ i,j = |h i,j | 2 are drawn i.i.d. according to some probability density function (pdf) f n (γ) . Once drawn, these channel variables do not change with time.\nNode i wishes to transmit signal x i . We assume that x i is a complex Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance. Each node is permitted a maximum power of P watts.\nWe incorporate interference and additive noise in our model as follows. Assume that k nodes i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i k are simultane-\nously transmitting signals x i 1 , x i 2 , . . . , x i k respectively. Then, the signal received by node j(= i 1 , . . . , i k ) is given by\nwhere w j represents additive noise. The additive noise vari- ables w 1 , . . . , w n are i.i.d., drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution of zero mean and variance σ 2 (w j ∼ CN (0, σ 2 ) ). The noise is statistically independent of x i .\nIn equation (1), suppose that only node i 1 wishes to communicate with node j and the signals x i 2 , . . . , x i k are interference. Then the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for node j is given by\nWe assume that transmission is successful if and only if the SINR exceeds some threshold ρ 0 .\nWe suppose that k nodes, denoted as s 1 , . . . s k , are randomly chosen as sources. For every s i , a destination node d i is chosen at random, thus making k source-destination pairs. We assume that these 2k nodes are all distinct and therefore k ≤ n/2. Source s\nwishes to transmit message M i to destination d i and has encoded it as signal x i .\nIn general, we suppose that the source-destination pair (s i , d i ) communicates using a sequence of relay nodes r i, 1 , r i, 2 , . . . , r i,h−1 . (h = 1, 2, . . . represents the number of hops.) Deﬁne r i, 0 = s i and r i,h = d i . The path from s i to d i is then r i, 0 = s i , r i, 1 , . . . , r i,h−1 , r i,h = d i . In time slot t + 1 we have nodes r 1,t , . . . , r k,t transmitting simultaneously to nodes r 1,t+1 , . . . , r k,t +1 respectively. We ask that nodes r 1,t+1 , . . . , r k,t +1 decode their respective signals x 1 , . . . , x k and transmit them to the next set of relay nodes in the (t+2)th time slot, and so on. A natural condition to impose is that the relay nodes that are receiving (or transmitting) messages in any time slot be distinct, i.e., the messages do not collide. In addition, we ask that relay nodes not receive and transmit at the same time. We refer to these conditions together as the property of no collisions in the rest of the paper.\nWith the above procedure, we have k simultaneous com- munications occurring in h time slots. Message M i reaches the intended destination d i successfully if it can be decoded by each relay r i,t . Assume that a fraction 1 − of messages reach their intended destinations in this way. Then, we deﬁne the throughput as\nThe number of source-destination pairs k, the fraction of dropped messages , the SINR threshold ρ 0 and hence the throughput T depend on n and we sometimes denote them by k n , n , ρ 0,n and T n . Typically, we force n to go to zero. We demonstrate a scheme for choosing the relay nodes and analyze the throughput as well as the performance for this scheme. Thus, we give an achievability result for T n . We begin by stating this result.\nTheorem 1: Consider a network on n nodes whose edge strengths are drawn i.i.d. from a probability distribution function f n (γ). Let F n (γ) denote the cumulative distribution function corresponding to f n (γ) and deﬁne Q n (γ) = 1 − F n (γ). Choose any β n such that Q n (β n ) = log n+ω n n , where ω n → ∞ as n → ∞. Then there exists a positive constant α such that a throughput of\n+ (k n (β n ) − 1)µ γ (3)\nis achievable for any positive a n such that a n ≤ 1 and any k n (β n ) that satisfy the conditions:\nlog(nQ n (β n )) → 0 (5)\nwhere µ γ and σ 2 γ are the mean and variance of γ respectively. The SINR threshold ρ 0 is given by \t a n β n σ2\nChannels stronger than the parameter β n will be called good and will allow us to schedule communications. Condition (4) is needed to ensure that we may obtain a non-colliding schedule of relays. (See Section V.) Once the schedule is obtained, we incorporate the effects of interference between non-colliding transmissions and analyze the error, n , in Section VI. Con- dition (5) forces n to go to zero. We combine the results of Sections V and VI to prove the theorem. We show how to apply the theorem and choose β n in Section VII where we\ngive several examples. Following that, the two-scale model is proposed and analyzed in Sections VIII and IX.\nWith a view to meeting a minimum SINR of ρ 0 at every relay node at every hop, we impose the condition that each transmitting link be stronger than some threshold β n . We require that γ r i,t ,r i,t+1 ≥ β n , where β n is a design parameter. We call links that satisfy γ\nas good. We require the path from s i to d i to use only good links.\nDeﬁne p n = P(γ ≥ β n ) (for convenience, we drop the subscript n in the rest of this section). Using our wireless communication network, we deﬁne a graph on n vertices as follows: For (distinct) vertices i and j of the graph, draw an edge (i, j) if and only if γ i,j ≥ β n in the network. Call the resulting graph G(n, p). The graph G(n, p) then becomes an instance of a model called G(n, p) on n vertices in which edges are chosen independently and with probability p [2]. This graph shows the possible paths from s i to d i using only good links, but does not show the interference between paths. We examine this interference in Section VI. Graphs taken from the model G(n, p) have many known properties regarding their connectivity, maximum minimum distance (called diameter) etc. [2]. We invoke a relatively recent result regarding vertex-disjoint paths for this model [13].\nTwo paths that do not share a vertex are called vertex- disjoint. Note that any two paths that are vertex-disjoint satisfy our \u201cno-collisions\u201d property; however, the reverse statement is not true. Thus, the vertex-disjoint condition is stronger than our requirement of non-colliding paths. For a set of k (disjoint) pairs of vertices (s\n, the question of whether there exists a set of vertex-disjoint paths connecting them is addressed in [13]. Their result states that, under certain randomness conditions, with high probability, for every set of k pairs (s i , d i ) and k not greater than αn log np log n , where α is a constant, there exists a set of vertex-disjoint paths. It turns out that the randomness conditions required for their result are easily met in our network setup. Here we state a simpliﬁed version of their result that can be directly used for our purposes.\nTheorem 2: Suppose that G = G(n, p) and p ≥ log n+ω n n , where ω n → ∞. Then there exists a constant α > 0 such that, with probability approaching 1, there are vertex-disjoint paths connecting s i to d i for any set of disjoint, randomly chosen source-destination pairs\nThe constant α in this theorem is the same α required in Theorem 1. It is not explicitly speciﬁed. It is now easy to reach a conclusion regarding the lengths that these k paths can have. We state it without proof in the following lemma.\nLemma 1: Almost all of the k = αn log np log n vertex-disjoint paths obtainable under Theorem 2 have lengths that grow no\n. We use this fact in the error analysis in the following section.\nAlgorithms that choose non-colliding paths without using information regarding the edges between vertices along one path to vertices along another have the property that these edges are i.i.d. Bernoulli distributed with parameter p. An example of a randomized algorithm that does this can be found in [13]. From this we conclude that the channel connections between nodes along different paths in the network are i.i.d. with distribution f\nWe now consider the probability that a particular message fails to reach its intended destination. Destination d i fails to receive message M i if the SINR falls below ρ 0 at any of the h relay nodes r i, 1 , . . . , r i,h = d i . Denote by E t the event that relay node r i,t does have an SINR greater than ρ 0 . Note that the events E 1 , . . . , E h are identical. Using a simple union bound, we get that the probability of error in the communication of message M i , called n , is bounded by hP ( ∼ E 1 ) . We can then bound P (∼ E 1 ) using a Chebyshev bound and get\n. (6) We force the last expression to go to zero. In order to apply the Chebyshev bound we need the condition ρ 0 ≤ β n σ2\nWe have the condition k ≤ αn log np log n from Theorem 2 (this gives us (4)), the condition ρ 0 ≤ β n σ2\nand the condition that the upperbound on n from (6) go to zero. With these we need to maximize the throughput. Putting these together, we obtain Theorem 1. For details refer to [15].\nTable I lists some distributions of common interest and the throughputs obtained using Theorem 1 on them.\n1) We see that the simple Bernoulli distribution, in which nodes are connected by a channel of strength 1 with probability p n and not connected with probability (1 − p n ) gives an almost linear throughput provided p n is chosen optimally, namely, p ∗ n = log n+ω n n for any ω n going to inﬁnity. This optimum connection probability is surprisingly low, in fact, it is just enough to ensure that the network is connected.\n2) A network where the channel strengths are drawn from the exponential distribution suffers from being very strongly connected and dominated by interference. It only gives a throughput of log n.\n3) Suppose that we are working with a network in which nodes are randomly placed at lattice points with edge distance d in a circular arrangement. Assume that the density of nodes is ﬁxed as ∆. Assume that a power decay law of 1/r m , m > 0 holds, where r is the distance. When a node at the center of this disk transmits\nwith power P = 1, the marginal distribution of the signal powers received by other nodes is given by the Decay pdf mentioned in the table. We see that for the decay exponent being greater than 2, we get almost linear throughput. We see that almost linear throughput can be obtained for m ≥ 2. This differs substantially from the O( √ n) results obtained for the structured deterministic model with the same decay law. Our results show that it is not the marginal distribution of the power that impedes the throughput in a geometric power-decay network, but rather the spatial distribution of these powers. 4) The table also lists a heavy tail distribution that gives a throughput polynomial in n.\nThus we see that the throughput varies drastically depending on the precise choice of the pdf. It can go from almost linear to only logarithmic, especially if the interference dominates.\nThe random model that has been presented and analyzed is at the oppposite end of the spectrum from the deterministic model of [9]. We now propose another model that works like the random model at the local scale and the deter- ministic model at the global scale. By choosing parameters appropriately in this model we can obtain the random or the deterministic model as special cases. Also, we use a combination of the techniques used in [9] and [15] to analyze the throughput. Consider a network with N nodes that are uniformly and randomly distributed on the surface of a sphere of radius R . We use a sphere rather than a planar disk to separate edge effects and have symmetry between all nodes. Also, the standard convention of measuring distances along great circles will be followed. The channel between nodes i and j is denoted by h\n2 , also as before. The average channel strength is assumed to be distance- dependent for nodes that are more than a certain distance, say r, apart and independent of distance for nodes that are within a distance r. More precisely, for nodes that are within a distance r, the channel strengths are drawn i.i.d., according to a p.d.f., say f (γ) . Let the expected value corresponding to this be denoted by µ γ .\nIf nodes i and j are at a distance l(i, j) > r from each other, we model h i,j to be a Rayleigh distributed random variable with its power (or second moment), E|h i,j | 2 , given by cg(l(i, j)) where g(x) is used to model the distance- dependence and c is a constant. This gives us that the corre- sponding γ i,j is drawn from an exponential distribution with\ncg(x) as its mean, i.e., cg(x) exp(−γ/cg(x)). Typically, g(x) is a decreasing function such as 1 x m with m > 2 or e −δx x m and c is chosen such that cg(r) equals µ γ . This is done to ensure that the expected value of γ i,j does not change abruptly as the distance between i and j changes from being less than r to being greater than r. Therefore, c = µ γ g (r) . In this paper we use g(x) = 1 x m with m > 2.\nDenote by p x (γ) the distribution from which the channel strength between two nodes with distance x between them is drawn. Then we have\nThe notion of interference and an SINR threshold of ρ 0 for successful communication are as before. However, we will use K to denote the number of source destination pairs and\nH to denote the maximum number of time slots required for a message to reach its destination. With this, the througput expression is (1 − ) K H log(1 + ρ 0 ) and we seek to maximize this as before. As for the random model we ﬁrst investigate the scheduling (Section IX) The error analysis follows and leading to a result regarding the achievable throughput in Section X.\nOnce again, we need to ﬁnd a set of non-colliding paths connecting the source-destination pairs. In order to accomplish this, we establish a Voronoi tessellation of the surface of our sphere such that each cell of the tessellation can contain a disk of radius r/12 and can be contained in a disk of radius r/6. From [9], we know that this is always possible. For such a tessellation, we can contain any particular cell, say S i , and all its neighbors in a disk of diameter r. Therefore all the channel connections in such a group of cells is drawn i.i.d. from f(γ). Denote by L i the line segment connecting them. This segment passes through several cells in order as it traverses from s i to d i . Note that the maximum number of cells it can pass through is M = c 1 R r for some constant c 1 . Denote these cells, in sequence, by s\n. (Some sequences may, in actuality, be shorter than M.) We will refer to the set of cells S 1,t , S 2,t , . . . , S K,t as the t-th layer of cells. For each occurence of a cell in the same layer or two successive layers, we would like to assign distinct nodes in the cell to do the job of relaying. We can show that this is possible if the condition K ≤ N/(8 cos 2 r 24R ) is met. Denote the node that acts as the relay for message i in layer t by\ns i,t ∈ S i,t . We will call the K sequences s i , s i, 1 , . . . , s i,M to be the superschedule.\nThe relays required for transmitting message M i from s i,t to s i,t +1 are determined through the subschedule. We assume that this takes at most h hops. In order to accomplish this we group the cells of the network into cell aggregates such that each aggregate lies entirely in a disk of diameter r. In fact, each aggregate is obtained by considering a cell and some of its neighbors in a speciﬁc manner. Time slots are considered in blocks of h time slots each. In any particular block, commu- nications take place only within each aggregate and not across\naggregates. Within each aggregate we expect to have atleast n = c 2 N sin 2 r 24R nodes and atmost n = c 2 K sin 2 r 12R pairs of relays from successive layers of the superschedule that wish to communicate messages to each other. But this is exactly the scheduling problem that we solved for the random network model in Section V using the notion of good edges, the random graph model G(n, p) and the result on vertex-disjoint paths from [13]. We use the same procedure here to obtain a vertex- disjoint subschedule that operates over h = log n α log np time slots, provided the condition K ≤ αN log np/(log n · cos 2 r 24R ) holds. Thus, with a particular grouping of cell aggregates, some of the communications from the t-the layer to the (t+1)- th layer get scheduled. In order for every communication from the t-the layer to the (t + 1)-th layer to get scheduled we repeat the process with a different set of randomly chosen cell aggregates. It can be shown that repeating the process log N times ensures (with probability going to 1) that all the communications from the t-th layer to the (t + 1)-th layer get accomplished. Details can be found in [16].\nTo conclude, all K communications can be scheduled using hM = log n α log np ·c 1 R r hops in hM log N time slots provided the conditions K ≤ N/(8 cos 2 r 24R ) and K ≤ αN log np/(log n · cos 2 r 24R ) hold.\nNext we do a probability of error analysis which involves a calculation of P(ρ i,l ≤ ρ 0 ) , where ρ i,l is the SINR at the l -th relay of message i. We do this calculation using a value\nwhere a ≥ 1. If we wish to force the probability of message M i getting through to its destination to go to 1, we get the condition log n α log np c 1 R r 1 a → 0. As for the error analysis of the random network done earlier, this condition comes from using a union bound over the number of hops and bounding the probability P(ρ i,l ≤ ρ 0 ) , this time through a Markov inequality.\nPutting together the scheduling and probability of error results, we get the following theorem.\nTheorem 3: Consider a network of N nodes, uniformly and randomly distributed over the surface of a sphere of radius R. For two nodes within a distance r, channel strengths are drawn i.i.d. from a pdf f (γ) with mean µ γ . Otherwise they are drawn from an exponential distribution with a mean of µ γ r m /x m , where x > r is the distance between them. Let F (γ) denote the cumulative distribution function of f (γ) and Q(γ) = 1 − F (γ). Let n = c 2 N sin 2 r 24R where c 2 is a known constant. Choose any β such that p = Q(β) = log n+ω n n , where ω n → ∞ as n → ∞. Then a throughput of\nis achievable where α and c 1 are constants and K and a ≥ 1 are chosen such that the following conditions are satisﬁed.\nwith t > 2 as the distribution from which the channel strengths are drawn i.i.d. for nodes within a distance r from each other. We need t > 2 for µ γ to be ﬁnite. We will assume that the other connections are exponential with the mean following a distance decay law of g(x) = 1/x m for m > 2. For this, we can show that a throughput of T = N 1 t−1 / log 2 N is achievable. For t just greater than 2, this is almost linear but for t > 3, it falls below √ N . It is interesting to note that m plays no role in the ﬁnal throughput expression.\nWe have proposed a random model for a wireless networks and shown that it can give throughputs that are almost linear in the number of nodes. We have also proposed a two-scale model of which the random model is a special case and presented an achievable throughput for this. We see that these models are capable of giving throughputs that scale much better than the √ n expected under deterministic distance models."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"F. Baccelli"},{"name":"M.
