Thus, com- munication and sensing share both the bandwidth and transmit power at each node in the network, in contrast to most sensor network formulations in the work. The bulk of the prior literature on communication and sensing in sensor networks focuses on estimating a parameter or process extrinsic to the network and then using the sensor network for communicating an estimate or a pre-estimate to a fusion center or base-station type node (e.g. [1\u20133]). While the work in [4] also considers extrinsic parameter estimation; there is a tradeoff to be made between sensing (estimation) and communication. In [4], each node in the network observes a single phenomenon and thus each node has correlated observations. The tradeoff therein considers the rate to be assigned to each node for transmitting the innovation at each node.\nIn [5], we introduced our joint sensing and communica- tion problem, where end-to-end distortion was considered for simple two-hop networks. In the current work, we extend our results to multiple hops and make rigorous a conjecture made in [5] for many-to-one network topologies. Herein, we shall focus on the encode-and-forward protocol for shared modality sensor networks. This protocol is inspired by well- known protocols for data forwarding in relay channels [6, 7]. A lower bound on the distortion for channel estimation for linear networks (nodes arranged in a line as depicted in Figure 1) is developed and analyzed for asymptotically high SNR, thus generalizing results in [5].\nTo consider problems seen more often in the real world, we next examine a more complex network topology. This is a two level tree-network where the ﬁrst level has M nodes connected to a single relay node. The relay node then communicates (and senses) with the destination node as shown in Figure 2. The encode-and-forward results are generalized for this topology. We also prove that time orthogonal communication is optimal for the ﬁrst hop of the network.\nThe joint sensing and communication leads to some in- teresting differences compared to traditional sensor networks. The single hop results of [8] suggest an intuitive scheme for state estimation when the transmitter has perfect knowledge of the state. However, this is not the case in most prac- tical systems. Moreover, as the number of hops increases, the problem becomes more complicated because the number of observations is ﬁxed. A few general observations from the problem illustrate its speciﬁc characteristics. First, more transmit power not only improves communication performance (throughput and/or error rates), but also simultaneously im- proves sensing accuracy. Thus, for sensor nodes with limited energy resources, the sensing and communication tasks do not \u201ccontend\u201d for the same source of power. In contrast, in most sensor networks, the battery power is shared between sensing and communication subsystems such that more power for one task does not necessarily improve the performance of the other task. In fact, this is the major reason why we can study sensing performance asymptotics as a function of received\nSNR for small networks, while most asymptotic analysis in sensor networks requires a large network [9, 10]. However, note that for the shared modality networks, the resource of bandwidth or time is one for which there is contention.\nSecond, the shared sensing and communication networks have fewer unknowns to estimate than most other sensor networks. Consider two sensor networks: one in which the channel is the sensor data of interest (the network analyzed in this paper) and one in which sensor data is independent of the channel (traditionally analyzed sensor networks). In both cases, the channel is unknown and hence the communication task has to account for the time-varying unknown channel. However, in the ﬁrst network, there is no other unknown while in the second network, the additional unknown is the output of the sensors (the sensor data). Thus, the number of unknowns in shared modality networks is smaller. We make no direct comparisons between these two classes of networks as they cannot be interchanged in practice.\nIn this paper, we develop lower bounds on the end- to-end distortion for encode-and-forward based estima- tion/communication protocols. For the encode-and-forward scheme, as presented in this paper, it is interesting to note that the bottleneck link (the one that transmits for the least time) affects the estimates of all links before it. This lends itself to heurestic schemes for improving network performance in an intuitive minimax way. It will be interesting to see if these results carry over to other network topologies and/or other communication schemes like the amplify-and-forward protocol.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the signal model and the formulation of the problem as a minimization problem and deﬁnes the different communication schemes. In Section III we consider encode- and-forward for a linear network. These results are extended to a variation of the linear network in Section IV. Section V presents and discusses a few numerical results and ﬁnally, we summarize and discuss avenues for further research in Section VI.\nConsider the N -node network in Figure 1. At each node,n, Y n is the received message and X n is the corresponding sent message. The channel between node i − 1 and i is denoted by h i ; thus the channel between the source (node 0) and node 1 is h 1 . All channels, h i , are assumed to be narrow-band and ﬂat fading. The channel gains are standard Gaussian random variables, h i ∼ N (0, 1) and the additive channel noises are Gaussian as well, Z i ∼ N (0, σ 2 i ). The channel coefﬁcients and noises are also assumed to be mutually independent. Finally the channels are assumed to have a common coherence interval of T seconds, such that all channels change to a new realization every T seconds. We make the following simplifying assumption \u2013 communication in the network is time orthogonal, i.e when one node is transmitting data, every other node is silent.\nThe observed distortion in the channels is of interest at the destination. The distortion between the estimate and the actual channel is given by their mean-squared error,\nwhere h i,d is the reconstruction at the destination. The feasible distortion region D is then described as all those (D 1 , D 2 , . . . , D n ) n-tuples which can be simultaneously achieved. Of interest is investigating the achievable diversity of the joint communication and sensing problem. We shall deﬁne diversity as the exponent on the decay rate of the distortion as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio. That is, we achieve diversity r if\nAs previously noted, we assume encode-and-forward based inter-node communication. That is, each relay node, j, forms an estimate of the channel for all preceding nodes. , node j estimates h j 1 and optimally encodes this vector for communi- cation over channel h j , to the next node in the network j + 1.\nThe following equations describe the signal model for the n-hop linear network,\nY 2 = P 1 β 1 f 1 (ˆ h 1 )h 2 + Z 2 , t ∈ I 1 .. .\nand n i=0 T i = T ). Given our focus on mean-squared error, the optimal estimator is the minimum mean-squared error estimate (MMSE). We denote the MMSE for channel i at node j as, ˆ h j i = E[h i |Y j ]. In the encode-and-forward scheme, preliminary estimates of all channels preceding are made at a node, thus we deﬁne ˆ h i,...,j = [ˆ h i ˆ h i+1 . . . ˆ h j ] as the MMSE of h i,...,j . The minimum distortion for the estimate of h i at the destination node is denoted D i . Finally, we deﬁne D j i to be the contribution to the minimum distortion in h i at the jth node. Note that D i = n j=i D n j . This decomposition holds due to the orthogonality of the MMSE detector(see also [11]).\nD j i ≥ var(ˆ h j−1 i )(1 + SNR j ) − Tj T \t (1) where ˆ h j i = E[h i |Y j ] \t (2)\nProof: We use the expression for the rate distortion function for Gaussian channels, use the coherent capacity as a bound for the non-coherent capacity and then use Jensen\u2019s inequality to bound the coherent capacity conditional on the channel re- alization. (See [5] for an extended, more methodical derivation of this lemma which exploits the results of [11]).\nProof: If we assume that we know h 1,...,i+1 in addition to Y i , this bound follows from the computation of the estimation error for the MMSE.\nGiven the signal model described above, we can form the following lower bounds:\nwhere, L i is the bound on D i and the bound L j i on D j i is formed as:\nProof: Recall that ˆ h j i is the MMSE of h i at node j. Then, by deﬁnition, var(ˆ h j i ) = E ˆh j i\n. By the orthogonality property of MMSE\u2019s, we can show that:\nsince the variance of the estimator can only increase as we get further away from hop i.\nInitializing with L i i from Lemma 2 and applying Equation (11) recursively leads to the bound in the theorem statement.\nCorollary 1 (Diversity Factor for n-hops): For \t encode- and-forward, assuming that SNR j = SNR ∀ j, the diversity factor for estimating h i is bounded as,\nWe deﬁne A j = 1 + SNR j . Using Equations (6) and (7), the expression for L j i is:\nNow, let SNR j = SNR ∀ j, then A j = A ∀ j and the above summation simpliﬁes to:\nAs SNR → ∞, the term in the sum above corresponding to k = j dominates the expression (since it has the largest exponent). To form the lower bound, the L j i \u2019s are summed. As such, the diversity factor for estimating h i is upperbounded by\nWe note that subsequent channel estimates will achieve lower end-to-end distortion than \u201cearlier\u201d channels. We next formalize this notion for the three-hop case,which is easily extended to n hops. First, we normalize the observation interval T to 1 over which communication and estimation is conducted. The bounds from Theorem 1 can be shown to have the following relationships:\nSNR 3 T 3 + 1 \t (13) < (1 + SNR 3 ) −T 3 \t (14) < L 2 \t (15)\nConsider f (x) = (1 + x) y − 1 − xy, then f (0) = 0 and f (x) < 0 whenever x > 0 and y < 1. This proves Equation (14) while Equation (15) follows since D 2 can be written as a convex sum of 1 and the quantity in Equation (14) which is upper bounded by 1. Similarly, we have;\nwhere α = 1 − (1 + SNR 2 ) −T 2 and 1 1−β = SNR 2 T 2 + 1 (this statement follows by simple algebra after setting SNR 1 → ∞). Again we appeal to the properties of the function f deﬁned above and those of convex combinations to verify that Equation (16) is valid.\nOur ultimate goal is to investigate the joint sensing and communication problem for arbitrary network topologies. To this end, an important generalization of the linear network is to consider a two-level network where multiple nodes communicate to a relay and then the relay communicates over a single channel to the destination. We denote this topology as\nthe many-to-one network. Our goal in this section is determine a good communication protocol for the ﬁrst level of the many- to-one network described in Figure 2. The quality of a com- munication scheme is gauged by the sum distortion of all the channels at the destination. In this scenario, the relay receives training signals from M sources for the M channels. The relay then jointly codes the estimated channels and transmits them over the ﬁnal link to the destination. The destination must then decode/estimate all M + 1 channels of interest. We observe that several protocols are possible for this problem and we prove that any orthogonal communication scheme is optimal for this network. In particular, time orthogonal communication is one optimal scheme and is employed for its ease of use.\northogonal communication scheme is optimal, in the sense of minimizing the sum distortion of the channels, for the many-to-one network shown in Figure 2.\nProof: The signal received at the relay can be written in vector form as:\nwhere A is a matrix that depends on the signalling scheme used, and n is the noise vector. Note that the dimensions of y, h and n are M × 1 and A is M × M . The ith column of the matrix A is formed at the relay node by collecting all elements of the received signal which have contributions from h i . The only constraint in the problem is M i=1 λ 2 i ≤ P where λ i is the i-th eigenvalue of the matrix A and P is the total power transmitted by the source nodes. Since we assume that the channel is independent for each source and that the channel is normalized, mean-zero and Gaussian, we have h ∼ N (0, I). Finally, since we assume that the channel noises are mutually independent, we have n ∼ N (0, diag(σ 2 1 , . . . , σ 2 M )). For convenience, we deﬁne S = diag(σ 2 1 , . . . , σ 2 M ).\nGiven the signal model in Equation (17), since the relay node knows y and A, we can form an MMSE of h, say ˆh.\nwhere D is the total sum distortion observed at the relay node. To minimize D, we then need to minimize the sum on the right hand side of Equation (18):\nThis equation can be solved by Lagrange multipliers and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (since λ 2 i must be positive) conditions to to yield the solution:\n(x) + = x if x > 0, 0 if x ≤ 0.\nIn particular, we can create a diagonal matrix for A, the eigenvalues of which satisfy the conditions outlined above thus proving the theorem.\nNote that Theorem 2 only claims the optimality of orthogo- nal communication schemes for the problem of minimizing the sum distortion of all channels at the relay and that these claims need not hold when the criterion for optimality is changed, for example, to minimizing the sum of the probability of error for all the channels. Once time orthogonality is accepted as optimal, the end to end distortion faced by individual sources can be bounded by an application of Lemmas 1 and 2:\ni T i + 1 D M +1 ≥ \t 1 SN R\nwhere we assume we are given the source powers {P i } M +1 i=1 , the channel noises variances {σ} M +1 i=1 and the optimal trans- mission times {T i } M +1 i=0 for all the nodes in the network.\nA comparison of the lower bound derived in Theorems 1 and 2 for the case when the network comprises of two and three links is presented in Figure 3. We consider sources with an SNR of 20dB and total time T set to 1 for normalization. Note that in the three hop case, we optimize for D 1 over the time spent in the second and third channels and that in the 2- to-1 network, the time spent in the ﬁrst link is divided evenly between the two sources (which is intuitive given the equal powers for the two sources).\nObserve that the bounds are very steep at low T 1 . This is to be expected for the conditions assumed (SNR 1 = SNR 2 = SNR 3 =20dB), since at low T 1 , any increase provides a large improvement in distortion. Also note that the bound for the two-hop network is less sensitive to changes in T 1 for a large interval of time while the three-hop bound is \u201csharper\u201d. As the number of nodes in the network grow, the bounds become more sensitive to T 1 due to the larger number of variables that inﬂuence the bound and need to be optimized over. Further, the slope of the curves changes as T 1 → 1. (D 1 = 1 trivially when T 1 is 1). This is because when T 1 is close to 1, while relay node 1 has a good estimate of h 1 , since this information now has to travel over more hops (in the same time) to reach the destination, the distortion faced is greater which translates to a lower slope for more nodes. As the number of nodes tends to ∞, it is to be expected that the curve approaches the point (1,1) at a zero slope.\nIt is intuitive to observe that the distortion in the 2-hop topology and the 2-to-1 topology are similar. Further, the 2-to- 1 case is lower bounded by the 2-hop case since the time spent in the ﬁrst link is now used to estimate two different sources thus leading to a higher distortion in both. Also note that while the 2-to-1 topology has the same number of channels of interest as the 3-hop network, the hierarchically layered nature of the 2-to-1 network leads to a reduced distortion at the destination. This feature is expected to become more\nprominent as the number of nodes increases while the time available for communication remains ﬁxed.\nWe have derived lower bounds on the distortion in channel estimates for a simple linear network as in Figure. 1 with encode-and-forward based communication between the relays. For a symmetric case, where each link has the same SNR, the distortion for the estimation of channel i is limited by the smallest transmission duration between node i − 1 and the destination. This suggests that for more general cases there is an effective SNR and transmission duration measure that should be equalized over all links in order to ensure equal distortion at the destination. In addition, we have shown that under very mild conditions, orthogonal communication yields lower distortions than any other communication scheme for the many-to-one network in Figure. 2. Ongoing work is completing the derivation of distortion bounds for amplify- and-forward based communication for multihop networks and applying the current results to more complex networks such as those with tree topologies."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R.
