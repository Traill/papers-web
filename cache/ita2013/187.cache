Moreover, the inherent decentralized nature of wireless networks mandates that efﬁcient and distributed algorithms be developed to implement this optimization. In this paper, we present an analytical framework within which power control, routing, and congestion control for wireless networks can be optimized in an integrated manner. We then develop distributed network algorithms which achieve the joint optimum.\nThe study of network optimization initially concentrated on trafﬁc routing in wireline networks. An elegant optimal routing problem within a multi-commodity ﬂow setting is given in [1]. Distributed routing algorithms using the gradient method are developed in [1], [2]. With the advent of variable- rate communications, congestion control in wireline networks has been an important topic of investigation. In [3]\u2013[5], congestion control is optimized by maximizing the utilities of contending sessions with elastic rate demands subject to ﬁxed link capacity constraints in wireline networks. The combination of congestion control and routing (both single- path and multi-path) is studied in [6], [7].\nWireless networks differ fundamentally from wired net- works in that link capacities are variable quantities that can be controlled by varying transmission powers. The power control problem has been extensively studied for CDMA\nnetworks. Previous work at the physical layer [8], [9] gen- erally focus on the optimal trade-off between transmission powers and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratios (SINR). More recently, cross-layer optimization for wireless networks has been investigated in [9], [10]. These papers typically assume that all available paths to the destinations are known at the source nodes, which make the routing decisions. Due to frequent changes in network topology and node activity, however, the source routing approach may not be practical nor even desirable for wireless networks.\nIn this work, we present a framework in which the power control, routing, and congestion control functionalities at the physical, MAC, network, and transport layers of a wireless network can be jointly optimized. We perform this joint optimization on a node-by-node basis, i.e., each node decides on its total transmission power, power allocation, and trafﬁc allocation on its outgoing links based on a limited number of control messages from other nodes in the network. We adopt interference-limited physical-layer models where link rates are functions of the SINR at the receivers. These include CDMA network models as a special case. We use a multi-commodity ﬂow model to analyze the data trafﬁc. We ﬁrst investigate the case where power control and routing variables are chosen to minimize convex link costs reﬂecting, for instance, average queueing delays. We develop a class of distributed scaled gradient projection algorithms and show that with appropri- ate scaling matrices, the algorithms jointly converge to the global optimum from any initial conﬁguration with ﬁnite cost. Finally, we demonstrate that congestion control for users with elastic rate demands can be seamlessly incorporated into our analytical framework. We consider a situation in which the network seeks to balance user demands and network cost by maximizing the aggregate session utility minus the total network cost. With the introduction of virtual overﬂow links, we show that the problem of jointly optimizing capacity allo- cation, routing, and congestion control in a wireless network can be made equivalent to a problem involving only capacity allocation and routing in a virtual wireless network.\nLet the wireless network be modelled by a directed and connected graph G = (N , E), where N and E are node\nand edge sets, respectively. A node i ∈ N represents a wireless transceiver and an edge (i, j) ∈ E corresponds to a unidirectional wireless link from node i to j. We assume that the wireless network is interference-limited, so that the capacity of link (i, j), denoted by C ij , is a nonnegative function of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver of the link, i.e., C ij = C(SIN R ij ), where\nHere, P mn is the transmission power on link (m, n), G mj denotes the (constant) path gain from node m to j, N j is the noise power at node j\u2019s receiver. We assume C(·) is increasing, concave, and twice continuously differentiable. For instance, in CDMA networks using single-user decoding, the information-theoretic link capacity per unit bandwidth is given by C ij = log(1+SIN R ij ). Assume every node i is subject to an individual power constraint and denote the set of all feasible power vectors by Π = {P ≥ 0 : j P ij ≤ ¯ P i , ∀i ∈ N }.\nWe adopt a ﬂow model [11] to analyze the transmission of data inside the network. Consider a collection W of communication sessions. Each session w is identiﬁed by its source-destination node pair (O(w), D(w)). Assume the total incoming rate for session w is a positive constant r w and denote session w\u2019s ﬂow rate on link (i, j) by f ij (w). We then have the following ﬂow conservation relations. For all w ∈ W,\nwhere O i = {j : (i, j) ∈ E} and I i = {j : (j, i) ∈ E}, and t i (w) is the total incoming rate of session w\u2019s trafﬁc at node i. For brevity, denote the set of all ﬂow vectors f = (f ij (w)) (i,j)∈E,w∈W satisfying (1) by F . Finally, the total ﬂow rate on link (i, j) is F ij = w∈W f ij (w).\nLet the network cost, denoted by D, be the sum of costs on all the links. The cost on link (i, j) is given by function D ij (C ij , F ij ). In previous literature on optimal routing in wired networks [1], [2], [12], where the link capacities are ﬁxed, the link cost D ij (C ij , ·) is usually assumed to be increasing and convex in F ij . Wireless networks, on the other hand, provide the possibility of controlling link capacities by, for instance, varying transmission powers. Since increasing link capacity reduces link cost such as queueing delay, we assume that D ij (·, F ij ) is a continuous, decreasing, and con- vex function of C ij for each ﬁxed F ij . We further assume D ij (C ij , F ij ) is twice continuously differentiable in the region X = {(C ij , F ij ) : 0 ≤ F ij < C ij } ∪ {(0, 0)}. Also we deﬁne D ij (C ij , F ij ) = ∞ for F ij ≥ C ij and F ij > 0 to\nimplicitly impose the link capacity constraint. To summarize, for all (i, j), the cost function D ij : R + × R + → R + satisﬁes\nif (C ij , F ij ) ∈ X , and D ij (C ij , F ij ) = ∞ otherwise. An example cost function satisfying the above conditions is\nwhich gives the expected number of packets in the queue of link (i, j) under an M/M/1 approximation. Summing over all the links, the network cost gives the average number of packets in the network.\nWe now formulate the Jointly Optimal Power control and Routing (JOPR) problem: given the session input rates (r w ),\nThe objective function in (2) is convex in all ﬂow variables. It is convex in P if every C ij is concave in P . Unfortunately, given that C ij = C(SIN R ij ) is strictly increasing, 2 C ij (P ) cannot be negative deﬁnite. However, if\nthen with changes of variables S mn = ln P mn [13], 2 C ij (S) is negative deﬁnite and the objective function is convex in S. This observation is ﬁrst made in [14], where the capacity function is required to satisfy −xC (x)/C (x) ∈ [1, 2]. Our results, however, indicate that the upper bound 2 can be re- moved. The detailed proof is omitted here for brevity. In what follows, we assume (3) and use the log-power transformation.\nTo solve the JOPR problem, we ﬁrst investigate distributed routing schemes for adapting link ﬂow rates. Path-based source routing methods in wired networks [4]\u2013[7] generally assume that source nodes have comprehensive information about all paths to their destinations. Wireless networks, however, are characterized by frequent topology changes. Thus, it is neither practical nor even desirable for sources to frequently obtain current path information. We therefore focus on node-based routing [1], where each node decides on its outgoing trafﬁc allocation based on limited information from its neighboring nodes.\nTo decouple ﬂow conservation constraints (1) across differ- ent nodes, we adopt the routing variables [1] deﬁned for all i ∈ N and w ∈ W in terms of link ﬂow fractions:\nFlow conservation translates into the following constraints for {φ ik (w)}: for all i ∈ N and w ∈ W, φ ik (w) ≥ 0 ∀k ∈ O i ,\nk∈O i φ ik (w) = 1 if i = D(w), and φ ik (w) = 0 ∀k ∈ O i if i = D(w).\nAs in the case of the routing variables, deﬁne the power control and power allocation variables as follows:\nwhere S i = ln P i and ¯ S i = ln ¯ P i . With appropriate scaling, we can always let ¯ P i > 1 for all i ∈ N so that ¯ S i > 0. Thus, the constraints for η ik and γ i are: η ik ≥ 0, ∀(i, k) ∈ E,\nTo solve the optimization problem with an iterative gradient projection method, it is necessary to compute the cost gradi- ents with respect to optimization variables. For the routing variables, the gradients are given in [1] as follows.\n∂φ ik (w) = t i (w) · δφ ik (w), ∀k ∈ O i , where the marginal routing cost indicator is\nstands for the marginal delay due to a unit increment of session w\u2019s input trafﬁc at k. It is computed recursively by [1]: ∂D ∂r k (w) = 0 if k = D(w), and\nIn above equations, C mn stands for C (SIN R mn ) and IN mn denotes the interference plus noise on link (m, n):\nbe the solution of the JOPR problem in (2), the following conditions are necessary. For all w ∈ W and i = D(w) with t i (w) > 0, there exists a constant λ i (w) such that\nand for all i ∈ N , there exists a constant ν i such that δη ik = ν i , if η ik > 0, ≥ ν\n(9) δγ i\nIf the link cost functions D ik (C ik , F ik ) are also jointly convex in (C ik , F ik ), then these conditions are sufﬁcient for optimality if (8) holds at every i = D(w) whether t i (w) > 0 or not.\nDue to limited space, the proof is omitted here and can be found in [15].\nAfter obtaining the optimality conditions, we come to the question of how individual nodes can adjust their local opti- mization variables to achieve a globally optimal conﬁguration. We design a set of algorithms that update the nodes\u2019 routing, power allocation, and power control variables in a distributed manner, so as to asymptotically converge to the optimum. Since the JOPR problem in (2) involves the minimization of a convex objective over convex regions, the class of scaled gradient projection algorithms [16] is appropriate for providing a distributed solution with fast convergence rates.\nConsider node i = D(w). Omit the session index w for brevity. At the kth iteration, the routing algorithm in [2] updates the current routing vector φ k i by\nHere, δφ k i is the vector (δφ k ij ). The scaling matrix M k i is positive deﬁnite if t k i > 0, and M k i is the zero matrix if t k i = 0. The operator [·] + M k\n(B k i represents the set of blocked nodes of i relative to the session under consideration at the kth iteration. 2 ) relative to\nIn order for node i to evaluate the terms δφ ik (w), it needs to collect local measures ∂D ik ∂F\nfrom k ∈ O i (cf. (4)). Moreover, it needs to calculate its own marginal cost ∂D ∂r\nusing (5), and provide the result to corresponding immediate upstream nodes. B. Power Allocation Algorithm (PA)\nAt the kth iteration at node i, the current power allocation vector η k i is updated by\nNote that the derivation of marginal power allocation cost indicators δη ik involves only locally obtainable measures (cf. (6)). Thus, the power allocation algorithm does not need a protocol for collecting external control messages.\nAt the kth iteration, the vector of all nodes\u2019 power control variables γ k = (γ k i ) i∈N is updated by\nHere, δγ k = (δγ k ), V k is a positive deﬁnite matrix, and [·] + V k denotes projection on the feasible set F γ = {γ : γ i ≤ 1, ∀i}.\nIn general, (13) represents a coordinated network-wide power control algorithm. It becomes amenable to distributed implementation if and only if a diagonal scaling matrix is used, i.e., V k = diag(v k i ) i∈N . In this case, (13) is then transformed to |N | parallel local sub-programs, each having the form\nγ k+1 i = P C(γ k i ) = min{1, γ k i − (v k i ) −1 δγ k i }. \t (14) The formula for δγ i from (7) involves measures from all\nlinks in the network. We thus need to design a procedure to let every node i compute δγ i prior to the algorithm iteration. The following protocol is based on a rearrangement of (7):\nPower Control Message Exchange Protocol: Let each node n sum up the measures from all its incoming links (m, n) to form the power control message:\nwhich is then broadcast to the whole network. Upon obtaining M SG n , node i processes it as follows: if n is a next-hop neighbor of i, node i multiplies M SG n with path gain G in and subtracts the product from the value of local measure δη in ·η in ; otherwise, node i multiplies M SG n with −G in . Finally, node i adds up all the processed messages, and this sum multiplied by P i equals δγ i . Note that this protocol requires only one message from each node in the network per iteration.\nTheorem 2: Assume an initial loop-free routing conﬁgu- ration {φ 0 i (w)} and valid transmission power conﬁguration {η 0 i } and γ 0 such that D {φ 0 i (w)}, {η 0 i }, γ 0 ≤ D 0 < ∞. Then there exist valid scaling matrices M k i (w), Q k i , and V k for algorithms RT (·), P A(·), and P C(·) such that the sequences generated by these algorithms converge, i.e., (φ k i (w)) → (φ ∗ i (w)), (η k i ) → (η ∗ i ), and γ k → γ ∗ as k → ∞. Furthermore, if the link cost functions D ik (C ik , F ik ) are jointly convex in (C ik , F ik ), then {φ ∗ i (w)}, {η ∗ i } and γ ∗ constitute a set of jointly optimal solutions of JOPR (2).\nThe proof of Theorem 2, given in full in [15], shows that with appropriate scaling matrices, every iteration of every algorithm strictly reduces the network cost unless the corre- sponding equilibrium conditions (8)-(10) of the adjusted vari- ables are satisﬁed. Because the network cost is bounded from below, the cost reduction from the algorithm iterations must tend to zero and asymptotically the equilibrium conditions (8)-(10) hold at all nodes. By Theorem 1, we can conclude that the limiting network conﬁguration is jointly optimal. The proof also shows that global convergence does not require any particular order in running the three algorithms at all nodes. For convergence to the joint optimum, every node i only needs to iterate its own RT (φ i (w)), P A(η i ) and P C(γ i ) algorithms until φ i (w), η i , and γ i satisfy (8)-(10). 3 In particular, [15] provides an efﬁcient computation method for each node to determine the scaling matrices used in its own iterations.\nThus far, we have focused on optimal link capacity and routing allocation for given user trafﬁc demands. There are many situations, however, where the resulting network delay cost is excessive for given user demands even with the optimal conﬁguration inside the network. In these cases, congestion control must be used to limit trafﬁc input into the network. In this section, we extend our analytical framework to consider congestion control for sessions with elastic rate demands. We show that the problem of jointly optimal capacity allocation, routing, and congestion control can always be converted into a problem involving only capacity allocation and routing as we formerly studied.\nFor a given session w, let the utility level associated with an admitted rate of r w be U w (r w ). We consider the optimization problem of maximizing the aggregate session utility minus the total network cost [3], [5], that is\nWe make the reasonable assumption that each session w has a maximum desired service rate ¯ r w so that the session utility U w (·) is deﬁned over the interval [0, ¯ r w ], where it is assumed to be twice continuously differentiable, strictly increasing, and concave. Taking the approach of [11], we deﬁne the overﬂow\nrate F wb ≡ ¯ r w − r w for a given admitted rate r w ≤ ¯ r w . Thus, at each source node i = O(w), we have the modiﬁed ﬂow conservation relation: j∈O i f ij (w) + F wb = ¯ r w .\nLet B w (F wb ) ≡ U w (¯ r w ) − U w (r w ) denote the utility loss of session w resulting from rejecting F wb from the network. If we imagine that the blocked ﬂow F wb is routed on a virtual overﬂow link directly from the source to the destination [11], then B w (F wb ) can be interpreted as the cost incurred on that virtual link when its ﬂow rate is F wb . Moreover, because B w (F wb ) is strictly increasing, twice continuously differentiable and convex in F wb on [0, ¯ r w ], the dependence of B w (F wb ) on F wb is the same as the dependence of a real link cost function D ij (C ij , F ij ) on its ﬂow rate F ij . A virtual network including an overﬂow link is illustrated in Figure 1, where the overﬂow link wb is marked by a dashed arrow. Accordingly, the objective in (15) can now be written as\nNote that (16) has the same form as (2), except for the lack of dependence of B w (F wb ) on a capacity parameter. 4 Thus, the problem of joint capacity allocation, routing, and congestion control in a wireless network is equivalent to a problem involving only capacity allocation on real links and routing on real and overﬂow links in a virtual wireless network.\nTo specify the optimality conditions for (16), we continue to use the capacity variables and routing variables, except for a modiﬁcation of the routing variables φ i (w) when i = O(w), w ∈ W. In this case, deﬁne t i (w) ≡ ¯ r w and\nThe new routing variables are subject to the simplex constraint φ ij (w) ≥ 0, φ wb ≥ 0, j∈O i φ ij (w) + φ wb = 1. The optimality conditions for (16) are the same as in Theorem 1, except that the optimal routing conditions for all source nodes further include δφ wb = λ i (w), if φ wb > 0, δφ wb ≥ λ i (w),\nif φ wb = 0, where the marginal cost indicator δφ wb of the overﬂow link is computed as δφ wb = B w (F wb ). That is, the ﬂow of a session is routed only onto minimum-marginal-cost path(s) and the marginal cost of rejecting trafﬁc is equal to the marginal cost of the path(s) with positive ﬂow.\nWe have presented an analytical framework in which power control, routing, and congestion control can be jointly opti- mized in wireless networks. A set of distributed node-based gradient projection algorithms is developed where routing, power allocation, and power control variables are iteratively adjusted at individual nodes. The convergence of the al- gorithms does not depend on any particular ordering and synchronization in implementing the algorithms at different nodes. Finally, we demonstrate that congestion control can be seamlessly incorporated into our framework, in the sense that the problem of joint capacity allocation, routing, and conges- tion control in a wireless network can be made equivalent to a problem involving only capacity allocation and routing in a virtual wireless network with the addition of overﬂow links."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"R.
