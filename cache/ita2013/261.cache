"},"body":{"text":"Accurate measurements and adequate analysis of network characteristics are essential for robust network performance and management. Such real-data analysis plays a key role in network design and in the control of its dynamic behavior. One of the most important network performance quantities is delay as it strongly inﬂuences the conﬁguration and performance of network protocols such as routing and ﬂow control and network services such as voice and video over IP. Delay mea- surements are common in such environments and many others. Furthermore, continuous monitoring of delay is essential in many applications in order to check compliance with critical delay constraints.\nIn many cases the path from a source to a destination may differ from the path from the destination back to the source. Even when the two paths are symmetric, they may have different performance characteristics due to asymmetric loads or different QoS provisioning [1], [2]. Moreover, performance of many applications depends mostly on the delays in one direction [3]. For example, streaming applications performance depends more on the characteristics of the path from the source to destination. A typical client server transaction depends more on the quality of the path from the server to the client. Finally, for voice and video conferencing each unidirectional path is responsible for timely delivery. Consequently, the capability to measure or estimate one-way delays is very important.\nThe main obstacle in measuring one-way delays is that clocks in a network are not synchronized. Taking one-way measurements is quite simple. A node can send a probe packet with a time stamp on it to its neighbor. When the neighbor receives the packet, it marks its own time stamp over it. The difference between these two time stamps is a one-way\nmeasurement. Clearly, this one-way measurement equals the corresponding one-way delay only if the clocks of the two nodes are synchronized. Otherwise, the one-way measurement includes the corresponding one-way delay and the clock offset (that is unknown) between the nodes.\nGlobal Positioning Systems (GPS) provide accurate time synchronization between network nodes; unfortunately, GPS are scarce in computer networks. Moreover, an embedded GPS requires continuous reception of multiple satellites which is hard to accomplish indoors or at secured data centers. Network Time Protocol (NTP) is the current standard for synchronizing clocks, with respect to Universal Time-Coordinated (UTC), in the Internet [4], [5]. NTP measures round-trip delays and uses a halving procedure to estimate the clock offsets . A recent offset synchronization method was suggested in [6] for a Pentium based systems as an alternative to GPS synchroniza- tion. However, this method calls for a GPS level synchronized NTP server in the (delay-wise) proximity of the measurement endpoints, a requirement that is not practical many times for remote endpoints, branches and homes and cannot be implemented in non-PC based systems. A novel synchroniza- tion protocol based on NTP messages that provides better accuracy by optimizing a global cost function is described in [7]. However, all these clock synchronization procedures are working accurately only when the delay is symmetric. Another approach for synchronizing clocks in sensor networks based on the availability of broadcast and low propagation delay among neighboring sensors appears in [8].\nUnlike one-way delay, round-trip delay measurements are simple to conduct and they are accurate since the same clock is used while transmitting the packet and upon its return; a common approach used for estimating one-way delay is to measure round-trip delays and halve them. This requires not only that the route between source and destination be the same, but that trafﬁc loads and QoS conﬁgurations in both directions also be the same. However, as noted above, often this is not the case.\nWe present a novel approach for the estimation of one- way delays from one-way measurements that do not require clock synchronization among the nodes of the network. The approach is based on taking one-way measurements between neighboring nodes and pose these measurements as constraints to well deﬁned optimization problems.\nWe show that the one-way measurements impose constraints on the feasible values of the one-way delays. Our goal is to derive the \u2019best\u2019 estimate of the one-way delays given the\none-way measurements. We show how to exploit the one- way measurements to obtain the necessary constraints on the one-way delays and derive the number of independent constraints that can be obtained. These constraints are used in the optimization problems that we explore. For these problems we deﬁne objective functions that when optimized, provide the \u2019best\u2019 estimate for the one-way delays.\nWe investigate two different objective functions. The ﬁrst objective function is very intuitive and is based on the least square error (LSE) principle. According to this principle the solution that is sought for is the one that minimizes the square error. The second objective function is based on the maximum entropy (ME) principle. According to this principle the solution that is sought for is the one that maximizes the entropy. Note that the deﬁnition of entropy requires an underlying probability space. One of our contributions is the introduction of a method to induce probabilities upon network links that are relative to the delays over these links. The objective function based on the ME principle yields itself to relatively simple computations and results in a better one-way delay estimation for most cases checked.\nBoth objective functions provide estimates of the ﬁxed part (i.e., propagation) of the one-way delay. For the estimation of the variable delay one can use the same optimization methodology and common techniques that are available for the estimation of the distribution parameters. The solutions that are provided are easy to implement using standard probe packets among nodes (e.g., NTP, ICMP). Extensive numeri- cal experiments demonstrate that both schemes considerably outperform the traditional round trip delay halving.\nAs an example, Figure 2 shows the results of the 100 runs over a variety of selected links of the network in Figure 1. The y axis in each graph presents the fraction of runs where the propagation delay difference between the estimated value and the real propagation delay is not greater than the value described in the x axis. Figure 2 demonstrates signiﬁcant improvement in terms of the delay estimation of both the \u201cLSE\u201d and \u201dME\u201d schemes over the halving scheme. For example, in link 7, the estimated link propagation delay never exceed 5.1 and 3.7 time units in 100 runs for the LSE and ME, respectively, whereas for the halving scheme the maximum delay error is 13.8. Symmetric or nearly symmetric delay mean and variance such as in links 5,6 and 11,12 make the halving scheme the natural choice for estimating the one-way link\ndelay. It is important to note that the delay estimation on such links by LSE and ME does not fall much behind the halving scheme. On the other hand, on asymmetric links, the LSE and ME schemes signiﬁcantly outperforms the halving scheme.\nWe ran the same simulation as before, 100 times over the 5- node 16-link network where the delay at each link has Normal distribution. We estimated the distribution based on the Mean and Variance. We compared the results of the LSE and ME with the halving technique.\nFigure 3 shows that the estimates obtained by the LSE and ME are much better than those obtained by the halving scheme. We added to each graph in this ﬁgure the I-divergence\ndistance [9], which measures the difference between the estimated and true distribution. It is interesting to note the results of link 5, which was forced to be symmetric, i.e., to have the same Mean and Variance as link 6. The halving scheme is naturally the best for symmetric links. However, the difference from the two schemes is not very big. For link 5 the I-divergence distance is 0.1 and 0.9 from the link delay to the estimation based on halving and both LSE and ME, respectively. On the other hand, in links that are not symmetric, the improvement of LSE and ME over the halving scheme is very signiﬁcant. For instance, for link 1 the I-divergence distance is 20.9, 6.3 and 1.4 from the link delay halving, LSE and ME, respectively. Again, ME outperforms the LSE scheme.\nThe authors would like to thank Prof. Hanoch Levy for helpful discussions.\nThis research has been made possible in part by a grant from the Cisco University Research Program Fund at Community Foundation Silicon Valley."},"refs":[{"authors":[{"name":"V.
